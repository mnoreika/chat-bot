Shit!
Truman! Truman! Stop!
Come down now!
No!
Why? What's there?
Nothing's there. It's the same as this. Come down, please!
I told you to stay close. Don't ever leave my sight again. You gotta know your limitations. You could've been washed away by the tide.
Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".
Thanks anyway.
I want to be an explorer ...like Magellan.
...okay, okay, let's call it what it is... I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance is death insurance...you just gotta ask yourself two questions...one, in the event of your death, will anyone experience financial loss?...and two, do you care?
Hold on will ya? This's no good. Lumps all drownings together. I need drownings broken down by category.
...just think about what I've been saying and lemme...hello?...
Can you connect me with directory inquiries in Sydney, Australia? ...er, yes. Do you have a listing for a Lauren Powers... ...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia Powers...nothing? Thanks...
How's it goin', Truman?
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
Good. Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I'd ask for identification.
Hold on, Truman. I got somethin' to show ya.
The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese navigator, huh? I know you love this like me.
Not me. You got the wrong man.
See ya tomorrow, Truman.
You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road? They're pulling out a body. You know you shouldn't look, but you do.
Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough insurance.
...this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable - when will death occur? Could be a week, a month, a year. Could happen today...A sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella...No way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all...
Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.
Stapleton on Staten Island?
You know another one?
I can't do it.
A half hour across the bay. Sea air. Do you good.
No, I... ...I got an appointment uptown.
This is a sure thing. They're upping our quota. You need this.
Let's go further, daddy! Let's go further!
It's getting late, Truman.
Please!...
I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.
When will he be back?
Please...
Help!! Please, help!!
Thanks.
He did nothing.
I got it free with the tune-up.
You missed a section.
Do they hurt?
I was afraid I'd seize up during cross. One of the keys kept sticking.
Is he gonna take the stand?
No point. Two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs.
You gonna eat before you leave?
I'll get something out.
Did something happen today?
What could happen?
Ouch. Whose nuts were those?
Mine.
I gotta get out, Marlon.
Yeah? Outta what?
Outta my job, outta Queens...out!
Outta your job? What the hell's wrong with your job? You gotta great job. You gotta desk job. I'd kill for a desk job.
Sonofabitch.
It doesn't mean anything.
Nothing means anything. Try stocking vending machines for a living. My biggest decision of the day is whether the Almond Joys look better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.
I gotta get out.
Sure and go where?
Australia.
No shit. Where is Australia exactly? Near England?
See here, this is Queens. All the way round here, Australia. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there're still places in Australia where no human being has ever set foot.
So when are you leaving?
It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about that. I just gotta move slow. Pick a moment. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I get a retaining wall built on the back of the house I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone. Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that.
I never knew anybody who got out.
Tick-fucking-tock. That's the fucking problem, Marlon. I'm thirty-four. I'm older than Jesus Christ.
Where do the dreams go, Marlon?
You win.
I'm serious. Where do the dreams go?
They're still there. Just buried under what we settled for.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
Sure. It's halogen. You oughta report it. You coming for a drink?
I can't tonight.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
What are you doing? Come to bed.
I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Oh. God, everytime you and Marlon--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Meryl, it'd be an adventure.
We said we'd try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
You want to be an explorer? You mean like all the other great explorers from Queens? You don't even have a passport, Truman. I bet you don't even know how to get one.
This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
Daddy!!...Daddy!!...
Daddy...
Hey, stop! Stop!!
Two, four, oh, six.
Outta the way! Outta the way!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! No harm done! No harm done!
What're you doing? The man told you there's no such bus.
He's lying. Two, four, oh, six was definitely the number.
I never believed he was dead.
C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find a body. You know what the currents are like in that water.
You had to see his face when that wave hit. He wasn't scared Marion. It was like he was expecting it, waiting for it. He knew it was coming.
Why would he fake it? He's not Elvis Presley.
You know what was really strange about today? An old woman with a little dog and a businessman, walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork. They force him onto a bus against his will, a bus that doesn't normally stop outside my building. And when I'm giving chase, the bus never makes another stop and I get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure I never catch up with it.
Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars? What are you saying, the entire population of Lower Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street person? Oh yeah, that makes sense.
You think I imagined it, don't you?
I think you're missing your dad. The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?
You got sand in your cuffs.
Maybe you're right. If only the old woman hadn't left her dog behind.
Don't you dare go in. Truman. I just got her off to sleep.
It was Dad. I swear.
Well, the next time he shows up. bring him over. Until then, I'm not saying a word about this to Mom and neither are you.
If it wasn't him, it was his twin. Can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?
I was seven years old!
But you're here and he's not. Has it really taken you this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?
I'm telling you he's alive!
And I'm telling you he's fish food!
You did well.
We've tightened security.
Why would he do this to us?
Old age. Sentiment. You play someone's father all those years, you are someone's father...He sees the way Truman is. He feels responsible.
What're you doing out here?
Fixing the mower.
Your sister called. She was worried about you.
I saw my father on State Street dressed as a homeless man.
I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.
What do you want?
I made macaroni.
I gotta go out. About a replacement... ...mower blade.
Hey, Truman! Where you bin? You bin cheatin' on me?
Bout time you got this thing cleaned. Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady wear it.
God, do they still make this stuff? What's the Sell-By Date?
...you see him messing with the antenna...what did you think would happen?..."lapse of concentration", is that what you call it? I call it amateur-hour... In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to do it over.
You think this is funny?
The mask has slipped before. Everything can be explained.
What's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl.
Like I say, I don't normally do this. I gotta charge extra.
He's re-created the event on and off for a number of years. We've never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place...
We'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he'd say anything. She was a year older, wrote poetry, way out of his league...
Hi.
Lauren, right?
No.
Look. I was wonder--
--I can't go out with you.
I haven't asked you yet.
Well when you do, that's my answer. I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
Why, you married?
I'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza. How about Saturday?
No.
Friday?
Now.
Right now? We got finals.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Well, what do you want to do?
We knew we were taking a risk. She hadn't been properly coached, but we were torn... He'd summoned the courage to make the approach...We wanted to reward that. Of course she took full advantage...
I never knew this place existed.
Come on! Come on! It's wonderful!
I...I can't.
That's right. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about. Has someone been talking to you?
Get me out of here. I don't want to be here.
What are you talking about? Lauren! Lauren!
My name's not Lauren! It's Sylvia!
In a minute someone's going to come and stop me talking to you.
Who? There's no one around.
You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan. And your teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore." And all the other kids laughed. And you sat down.
How do you know about that?
It doesn't matter. You've forgotten about that boy, Truman. You got scared. Just because something happens, doesn't mean you can't take another chance in your life.
I don't understand.
There isn't much time. Just listen. Everybody's pretending Truman. Everybody but you. Look at that project. You think anybody lives there? It's all for you, Truman. A show. The eyes are everywhere.
Eyes? Where?
Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're going to fill your head with lies. You've got to make yourself deaf, you understand? When you're afraid the most, it means you're on the right track. Trust that boy. Promise me you'll do that?
I told you, Truman!
Hey!
Get in the car, Lauren!
Who are you?!
I'm her father!
No he's not! He's just saying that! Does he look anything like me?!
Shut your mouth!
Leave her alone!
I told you not to come here anymore! Which one are you?
Don't listen to him, Truman. Make yourself deaf. Come find me.
Don't bother! We're moving to Australia. New York's done something to her head.
Why did he say Australia? Why couldn't he have said New Jersey?
You want me to do it again? I think I could do it better.
No...thank you.
Veronica, what do you know for sure?
For sure? The nuns at my school, they used to say, "The whole of life is faith."
On the house.
We removed all physical trace of her but we couldn't erase the memory...
When he decided to go after Sylvia, we were forced to intervene once again...
I've got something to tell you, Sis.
I've got something to tell you too.
I'm going to Australia.
Mom's real sick.
I have an appointment at, er...Diamond Enterprises.
What're they doing?
Just tell me what the hell's going on?
Like fuck! What're they doing?
You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!
--I know.
You ever been into the AMT Building?
Not since they begun reconstruction. What're you doing with that?
I'm going to visit a site.
What for?
Because I never do.
That's why we got adjusters.
You got a problem with me going?
I got a problem with you not doing your job, Burbank. You already screwed up once this week.
Let me worry about that.
680 West 89th.
Is there another way? Can't you get around this?
When was the fire?
How come it's still smoking?
Says here it burnt to the ground.
Someone send you to tell me all this?
...Everybody stay focused...remember who you are...
Damn!
Small world.
You don't remember? Two days ago I gave you my meatball sandwich in the park. You were in a wheelchair. Same sneakers.
A miracle!
Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.
Truman! Sorry, I'm up against it today.
I've fallen over something, Marlon. Something to do with my Dad. I think.
Are you okay? You look like shit.
It's big, Marlon. You wouldn't believe who's in on it.
In on what?
There's no point trying to show you, they cover their tracks too well. But I've been going into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta familiar faces, y'know what I mean?
Something's definitely in the air. My last delivery, a kid got crushed to death. tilting a vending machine. They won't even let me take the rest of the day off.
Do it, anyway.
I'm deadly serious. Marlon. We can't talk here. I'm being followed.
Who?
I don't know. They look just like regular people. But I've been writing down numbers - license plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same ones keep cropping up over and over.
Is someone leanin' on you, Tru? Cos I got some friends here, they owe me. We can lean back. Is he one of them?
I don't know. Could be. One thing's certain. The key is spontoneity. Be unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get outta here. Can you come with me?
Christ, Truman. You're gonna get both our asses fired.
Where're we going?
The beach.
I can't believe how much he's shoved down. That he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely.
You remember, Moses, it used to end right there, before the expansion.
Christof, the cracks are starting to show.
I'll paper over them.
Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and recovered.
No, not like this. It's compromised. Becoming unwatchable.
Fear? Doubt? Is that what you have trouble watching? Perhaps you don't like watching yourself.
Why don't you two wait outside?
He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all. We'll get him back on.
You know why they're so nervous. The birth of Truman's child is going to double revenue. For God's sake don't let him upstage you. You've been grooming a successor.
He's not ready.
Him or you?
You can't pull him back in without me. He's just acting out of character.
What if he's in character? What if he's starting to act in character at last? Have you ever considered that?
What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
Where what started?
Things. Things that don't fit. Loose threads. False steps. Slips of the tongue.
Make sense, Truman. You going religious on me?
My father didn't want me to see what was over here. Whatever it was, it's gone now. I never shoulda listened to him that day. I knew it was wrong.
There were a hundred people on the beach that day. Everybody knew what was going on except me.
I don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you?
Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else. A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine. The week before an ad said, "Next Week Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".
A guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine. It ain't a common name so I looked out for it. But the day it came out, every newstand was sold out. No library had it. I even wrote off for a back-issue. Never seen a copy to this day.
Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
A coincidence. Haven't you ever heard of a coincidence?
I'm a walking coincidence. I can't count 'em. No something's happening, Marlon. I've got to get to the bottom of it.
Of what?! Why're you doing this to yourself?
I'm scared, Marlon. I'm as scared as hell. But I've never felt more alive. It's just like she said.
Who?
It doesn't matter. She was too beautiful for here.
Can you lend me some money? A hundred bucks.
All I got on me is the takings from the machines. Why do you need it?
I'm going away for a while.
What's going on, Truman? You're not yourself.
Maybe you just don't know me very well.
We could do it right here, like we used to.
Lemme go to the bathroom.
Don't be too long.
What happened overnight?
He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.
God, that thing of his must be psychic. He didn't masturbate?
Not for the last two inonths.
Aren't you gonna be late?
I got a call in the area. What's the case? Anything interesting?
Rape on the subway.
They're guilty as hell but they'll walk. No witnesses. Her word against theirs. Maybe we could meet for lunch today.
Er, yes... No, no I'm not.
I wanna book a flight to Australia.
Where exactly?
Australia.
Where in Australia? What city?
Sorry, Sydney. Sydney, Australia. That's right.
For how many?
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, that you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.
I'm sorry. I don't have anything for a week.
A week.
It's the busy season.
You sure you're not trying to keep me here? You are a travel agent, aren't you? Your job is to help people travel, not keep 'em where they are. Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Australia tomorrow. But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
You were expecting me, weren't you?
It's non-refundable.
Can we contain him long enough?
Why go to all the trouble?
He believes she has the answer.
Why not just tell him she's dead?
It's too late for that. That won't satisfy him. He's going to have to find out for himself. See it with his own eyes. Right now he needs something genuine. Even if we have to fake it.
"Yours truly..." You spell "truly" "l...y" or "e...l...y"?
Where the hell have you been, Burbank? What the hell's going on?
That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.
I was just about to resign. Isn't that a laugh? I just realized there's nothing to resign from, is there?
Listen, don't bother with the resignation. Just get the fuck outta here.
Why're you all pretending? Huh? What is this a front for? Why aren't I in on the joke? Was I away that day?!
I'm talking to you! Who am I?!
You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.
"Security! I'm calling Security".
You don't believe a single word you're saying! None of you do! You hear me?!
...and back to the close-up...
Do you think he sees the entry?
Hard to tell.
Why don't we ask him?
I don't know how it got there! Enhance.
Say my name or I'll smash its head open.
Say my name!
Say my name! You know my name! Say it!
I mean it! I'm ready to do it! What's my name?!!
This is your last chance!
What...is...my...name?!
See that car way down there? I bet it's a Suburu station wagon.
I predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic, a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing, a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle.
There's the Honda...the Dodge...here comes the dented Beetle...
Look, damn you!
Where's the motorcycle?
Don't you want to know how I did that? Maybe you already know. Is that it?
Where have you been? I've been calling you all day.
Have you been concerned, Meryl? Nice name. "Meryl". I always liked it.
Nice of you to say so after eight years.
Actress's name, isn't it? What's your real name?
Oh, God. What's got into you?
Take a break. Meryl I know.
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me...
Drop it, I said. It's over.
...we need more charcoal.
Shut up!
I'm gonna take a shower.
No. We're going for a drive.
What?!
For years I've been saying I want to go some place, well now I'm ready to go. Let's just jump in the car and go.
I thought maybe, Atlantic City.
You hate gambling.
That's right. I do, don't I?
So why do you wanna go?
Cos I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it? Cos you're curious. I haven't been curious since I was seven years old, y'know that? Back then you'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place.
How long to take Atlantic City out of mothballs?
We could be up and running...three hours maybe.
Give me a number five gridlock on the Jersey Turnpike.
So much traffic, this time of day. Does that strike you as peculiar?
Look at them. You believe they're fighting? I don't believe it. Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
You've never been on this road before. You don't know what it's like.
That's true. We could be stuck here for hours. Could be like this all the way to Atlantic City.
What the hell are you doing?
You're right. Let's go back. I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.
Would you please slow down, Truman?
Truman, that was the turnoff!
I've changed my mind again. What's Maine like this time of year?! I've never been to Maine. Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
I think I'd like a little company.
What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"? Keep them together.
They're rusty. We can't keep up. We don't know where he's going any more.
Oncoming is very thin.
Look down there, Meryl!...No cars! I don't run into traffic. The traffic follows me around. We're in a moving pack, don't you see?
He's so close! It's tantilizing!
You want to pull him over?
No police. Not yet. We shadow him. We don't want him to panic.
He's trying to outrun the traffic.
He's trying to outrun the world. Keep him on this route. Are we ready?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman. We have to go back.
No. There's no accident. It'S just more stalling.
What's going on?
Is there any way around?
Truman!! Come back!!
Did he see it?
I don't think so.
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
That's not true.
Don't lie to me!
Tell me what's happening?!
I thought you knew everything. What could I tell you?
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Truman, you're scaring me!
No, you're scaring me, Meryl!
Stop this now or I kill your leading lady. I know you can hear me.
Get somebody in there!
No.
She's in trouble! We've got to help her!
He's bluffing. Call his bluff.
Do something...
Who are you talking to?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? I swear I'll kill you, if you don't tell me.
How could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me?!
You have any idea what it's like to drown?
Truman, stop it! Don't let him do it!
I'll kill her!
Right on time. Cops must be telepathic.
Damn!
Stay where you are or I'll kill her!
Truman? It's me, Marlon.
They were going to let him kill me!
People know who I am, my every move, complete strangers know my name. Even when there's no one around, I feel the eyes on me.
I was in the bank today. The Federal on Lewis. A clerk was talking about somebody named Truman messing with her baby. Is that the stranger you're talking about?
No. No. I've never seen her before. I know you already think I'm going out of my mind but I genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow. Everybody seems to be in on it.
It's a lot of world for one man. You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
That's just it. I think I am somebody.
I used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room, thinking of ways to fuck me up.
Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes I think it's for real.
Tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard-on.
The only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other's test papers. Jesus, they were identical. I always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was right together and we was wrong together.
The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and I wet myself but you never told anyone. I was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and I didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been. And I never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that.
I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would. We all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should. I know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else. But, well, the point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you.
...and the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you...
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it cos there is no it.
I can't thank you enough. I don't know what happened. He was so close. It threw me. I'm indebted.
Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have been a more momentous week in the show's history. I'm your host, Michael Conners, and this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the forum where we discuss and analyze recent events with the show's award-winning creator and producer, Christof. I remind viewers that as this is a living history, it is our practise to keep the image of Truman on screen at all times. Welcome.
Thank you.
Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in ratings over the last few days, how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?
Ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment. However I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
It has to be the reality.
We've become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts. no cue cards. It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine. That's how he can support an entire channel.
A window onto the human condition?
I prefer to think of it as a mirror. Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.
You're on, caller. Go ahead.
Thank you.
I don't believe so. Not now. He tested his world, as we all do at certain times, and eventually it passed the test. You have to understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world he occupies his only frame of reference. No, for him to come even this close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts.
Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".
Working on "Truman" has always been a huge commitment for an actor, not just in terms of separation from friends and family, but since Truman essentially drives the plot, it's a never-ending improvisation. Recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige.
Of course Truman has always been very much in on casting.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned videographer, Christof.
Who can?
In his entire life, forty-two minutes. A technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of that time. The remainder generally results from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman would stray out of range of our cameras.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them. Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".
I believe that to be so. I often feel the only difference between Truman's life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented. We all play our allotted roles--
--He can leave at any time. If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him. I think what really distresses you, caller, is that ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"--
Do I know you, caller? Your voice sounds familiar.
Recording a human life from birth to death, that's still the intention? You still believe Truman has more to contribute?
More than ever. By unwittingly allowing us to witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing us to evaluate our own lives. He gives us hope.
Let's take another call. London, England you're on "Tru Talk".
What are you looking for?
He was premature, wasn't he?
Only by two weeks.
Curious even then? Like he couldn't wait to get started?
His eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
What was it like, the first show?
The ultimate live television. In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
Is it true what you said...on the show tonight? About letting him go if he wanted it badly enough. Would you really do that?
It won't come to that.
I hope we've got fresh extras.
The rotation was made this morning.
I don't like the couple with the baby. They'd never be together.
Who's doing wardrobe? I keep seeing the same wardrobe...
...everybody back to One...
...and, action background...
...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog... let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept together...everybody look like you've got places to go...
I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.
...Bodycam Two...
...streetlight eight...
...ready, Car-Cam One. Go to One...
...and cut to interior...
...looser...
...and action, Vivien... Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.
Damn, she missed her mark! Why do we bother with walk-throughs if nobody pays attention? Give me a two-shot of Truman and Vivien...go to the master ...hold the elevators... Vivien, press the elevator button again ...and make sure you catch his eye this time...
Good! Perfect! Cut to the interior...
...and Lawrence...
...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Regrettably, I have to inform you that Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.
I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.
Her separation from Truman will be orchestrated over the summer. However, I'm pleased to announce that television's first on-air conception will still take place. You witnessed the initial contact this morning. You all know Claudia from her work in theatre. Thankfully, Truman doesn't.
This is a copy of Claudia's back story. Her character's name will be Vivien. She's the new adjuster at the office.
We intend to entice Truman into the affair as soon as possible. Claudia will make her advance at the seminar Truman's attending next week. Details are in your schedules. I'm sure you'll all make Claudia welcome.
Question is, will Truman make her welcome?
I don't have to tell you, how critical the next few weeks will be. This takes us into the next generation. When Truman's child is born, the network will be switching to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.
There will simply be duplicate coverage.
When Truman dies do we go back to the single channel?
Give him a break. It's taken him thirty- four years to get the nerve to go in there.
...Ready two. Go to two.
And back to the medium.
...and wide...
Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?
That loser pays our salary.
He's given up on himself again.
Who cares? Makes life easier for us. He is what he is.
When did he start sleeping like that?
About the time Meryl left.
Is that the best shot we can get?
What's to see?
What happened to the room?
He started to reorganize. I was going to call you. But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's insurance convention.
Give me a shot from his wedding band.
He took it off.
Why is he so still? He's too still.
Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.
Give me a preview. An ECU on his torso.
Phone him.
He didn't drink tonight? No pills?
Hang up!
Get Marlon over there.
Under what pretext?
Any fucking pretext!
Tru!..Tru!..
I'm comin' in, Tru!
Cut transmission.
I said, "Cut"!
There. Freeze...Zoom into the chair...
Enhance.
He wasn't making a mess. He was engineering a blind spot.
How does he know where the cameras are?
We've declared a curfew. Only the extras required for the search are on the set. Everyone else is at first positions.
All prop cars accounted for?
He has to be on foot. He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.
The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug if we don't make a statement within the next hour. The media is in a feeding frenzy. The phone lines are jammed. Every network has a pirated shot of Harlon and the dummy.
Not yet.
Rumors are circulating he's dead.
The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.
Why? We're getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series.
When we flush him out how do we explain this?
We tell him the truth.
We're making a movie.
We'll get him on this next sweep.
What have we missed?
It's just a matter of time.
No. We've missed something.
You remember when you were a little boy...
...Trust that boy...
Trust that boy... We're not watching the sea.
Why would we?
Sweep the harbor.
That's him!
Resume transmission.
What do we have on that boat?
Fuck you!
Get the hell away! It's my life!
Fire a warning.
Jesus! God! Is he out of his mind?
Pull back.
How long will another chopper take?
By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.
We have to stop him for his own good. Turn him back with the elements.
There's no rescue boat in the area. He won't know what to do.
For God's sake, Chris. The whole world is watching. We can't kill him in front of a live audience.
He was born in front of a live audience. Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life for the truth. His doubts will turn him back.
Kill the lights.
I'm coming to find you Sylvia! I'm making myself deaf! You're going to have to kill me! Come on!
It's not working. He can sail that thing!
How can he sail?! He's in insurance! He hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!
On the behalf of the studio, I demand you cease transmission.
Keep running! I take full responsibility. How close?
Very close.
Capsize him! Tip him over!
You can't! He's tied himself to the wheel. He'll drown!
He doesn't care...
You lied, you hypocrite! The only way he can leave, is dead!
Do it!
It's too late...
Yeah!
Nobody move! Drive!
Keep talking. Say whatever you say!
Act normal! Keep filming!
What do you mean he's not there? We can't have lost him again.
Truman...
Even the stars I wished on...
You won't do it, Truman. I've watched you your whole life.
You never had a camera in my head.
Something was real! Something had to be real!
JACQUES touches bottom. Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down. Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under... he opens the plastic bag. A huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.
A coin.
I found it.
Liar!
Ok. I'll get it, but no fighting, all right?
We'll split it.
You can't split a coin. That's stupid.
He's right. You're stupid.
Then we'll buy something and split that.
A helicopter...
It's a small coin.
A Ferrari.
I don't want a Ferrari... What is it?
Maybe a little radio.
Well. We'll decide later. The light is going.
I get the radio from after school, until midnight.
Since when do you stay up until midnight?
All right, all right... Can I concentrate? And you can stop pointing. I've seen it.
Shit, it's the Italian!
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?
Fine!
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
No...
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
Roberto, mio palmo!
Count!


Who's is it now? You saw it but I dove for it!
Roberto? How long?
Six seconds.
I'll throw it back into the water. You dive and if you do less than six, it's yours.
Brava!
You can't split a coin, stupid.
It is. It's a coin! I'll get it for you, Father!
Padre?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
No.
I've seen them.
Don't you want to know where?
Why don't you ask me?
What?
Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Why did my mother leave?
Come on now, pump!
Your mother didn't leave. She went back to America, that's all. It's her home. She's allergic to this Island. She likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor... so one day she left. Woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea.
So where did you see mermaids?
In the bars in Athens!
Jacques! Jacques!
Signore Molinari?
Yes.
How did it happen?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up! Can you help?
How many are, down there?
Just one... We're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly... You've got to get him out fast.
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Dollars.
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
You do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world?
Yes, but ten thousand dollars...
Okay. You tell me. How much would you say the man's life is worth?
In my village, we have a saying when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
What does that mean?
That you should get your checkbook. Damn quick.
Since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check?
Sign here.
Thanks, thanks a lot. I mean that too... You extortionist bastard!
Dollars, Roberto! We took him for ten thousand dollars!
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really. What are you going to get?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for Angelica, something with rhine- stones for what's her name, and get yourself a suit that fits... But most important...
Yes?
Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.
Is this the Lago del Demonio? ... Huacracocha?
Gracias.
Welcome to Peru!
Don't you have a heater?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Does anybody live to make a second?
Forget about the heater!
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
... right. Dr. Lawrence? The insurance man... uh... The insurance person is here!
It's about time!
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Who?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Did you have a nice trip? We were getting restless, it's been three weeks since the accident.
You should get things moving, you know. We're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments...! Frank, check the program!
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
In the spring when he melts!
You really send him under the ice? He isn't a slave or a convict or anything?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
Listen...
That's his heartbeat. Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible.
He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Why is he doing this?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Coffee might be nice.
Will he understand Spanish?
His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
I recognize you.
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
No... in the hut.
Then it was somebody that looked a lot like you... Thank you.
I'll only be five minutes.
Good morning, everybody! Did you sleep well? I slept in a plane, and it wasn't too great.
Hey! presents.
You think I'd forget you?
For Bathsheba.
It's a Llama. You understand? From Peru. It's fighting.
That's for you, Darjeeling. We wouldn't want you to catch cold!
And now... "Ta, da..." For you Tina.
Something you've never seen either.
Snow!
A new experience, Tina. I missed you little rascals. Did you get my post card?
Oh? Is that what you want? Alright, but five minutes, no more. I have a taxi waiting.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
... Sally?
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
Again?
They got the new T.V.
... And the new stereo.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
You called the police?
They're going to send detectives. When they get around to it.
So what, all they ever want is your phone number anyway.
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
A cardiogram...? You met a doctor! Congratulations, you're in the chips... Unless they have socialized medicine in Peru. Do they?
It's his heartbeat.
Oh Jesus...! I'll make some coffee. They left the stove.
6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- You can't be sure, you know the flippers, they add height or they take it away, or something. Anyway short dark hair... Not punk or anything, just short. And the cutest smile. He wasn't smiling at me, I don't think -- just smiling. And he thought he saw me in the lake. I mean that was a figure of speech... They're so romantic, the French.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Haven't you been listening?
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.
Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Enzo...
I leave you swimming and twenty years later, you're still in the water! What the hell are you doing? Training?
Yes.
That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
They say I'm like Lazarus. You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Doesn't it surprise you that I just show up like this... Listen, the world championship starts in ten days in Taormina. Be my guest.
Your ticket.
Why?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me "D'you know that French guy, Mayol? He's supposed to be very good! Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. ... I'll see you there...
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
I said that the file is incomplete. See if you can get through to this Lawrence character and have him send the Peruvian registration for his missing truck... and don't let him tell you it was in the glove compartment.
Right Chief!
Did the driver really freeze?
Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
... So am I.
... I said, all the truck papers are in the glove compartment!
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete. Okay?
Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Then, goodbye.
Wait! Professor...?
... Yes?
You don't know how I could reach that diver of yours... Mayol... We need some additional information... I mean, we have a few questions to ask him.
The last thing I heard, he was off to Taormina for the world diving championships. That's Taormina, in Sicily!
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What d'you mean?
The mafia! La Cosa Nostra! Coppola! De Niro...! I knew it! I knew we shouldn't have written that policy!!
What's happened??
The documents are forged.
No!
Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
It can't be true!
We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook. There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I tried him, he can't go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Italian is practically the same thing.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Ah?!
Be careful with that car, it's a new paint job.
Giacomino! My friend! My brother!
So you finally decided to join us? You did the right thing!
Hey Paolo! Come stai? Get my key! You remember my little brother Roberto?
I remember. Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
Take mine. I'll take the Countess' suite. She told me she was leaving for the cemetery... She'll be more comfortable there.
I'm glad you're here.
"Spaghetti del mare" It's delicious here. It's the one thing they really know how to make.
Yes, sure, for two.
And a bottle of "Frascatti". Two bottles!
He moves just like a woman. It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh? To breathe in one, swim in the other...
Anyway! Nothing beats a sexy broad! Huh, Jacques!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
Yes, of course. Lots of questions.
Well, what are they?
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Well, then. I'll do the asking for you. "Tell me dear Enzo, how did you become World Champion?" Oh, that's a long story. Well, after you left Amorgos, I went back to Italy and joined the Navy. So you now have in front of you -- Captain Molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 years...
That's good.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
... You married?
No.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged... for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
Forget it. I was joking.
Eh! La Madonna! This one is for me. I'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight.
I tell you she's mine!
Hello!
You know each other?
Yes.
Enzo Molinari.
This is a great pleasure.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you. Well! Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here. It's incredible!
Please, have a seat.
Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
No, no!
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here?
It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am by the way world champion!
But what brought you to Sicily?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days off. I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
There is no place in the world more beautiful than Sicily!
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
I think I'll have a coffee.
No, no. You'll like it. It's superb.
... Okay. I'll try.
Where did you two meet?
In a lake.
I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Congratulations.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
Enzo?
What?
Your mother?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo! Ma mamia! Where...? God, she'll kill me... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... Mamma!
You expect me to carry all the luggage myself?
Mamma. Roberto and an elevator... Isn't that enough?
What have you been eating?
Coffee only, I'm diving tomorrow. You remember little Jacques, Jacques Mayol...
Madame...
... And his friend, Johana...
Thank you.
Americana?
Benvenuto!
Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I don't know... why?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you. But you are going to be very busy. You must have tons of things to prepare, interviews... And a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
You can put down the suitcases, you know.
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world champion.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Get in the car!
Roberto! The bow-tie!
Very good.
What about the shoes?
Very chic. Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
No.
Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
It's too loud for me.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention, please. Mr. Andre Bonnet, President of the International Diving Championship Committee, is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving. This afternoon, our new champion descended to the remarkable depth of 280 feet.
This young man Tia...
Tiraro... Tirao-re... Moa...
... Let's all give him a big hand.
A one day hero!
A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
No.
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
You forgot the Hula!
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
I don't know how... Excuse me.
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Have you known him long?
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
Forget it, don't think of Jacques as a human being. He's from another world.
And just where are you from?
Italy!
There is nothing like music. It speaks from the heart. Can you tell me why we bother diving in the dark, the cold, without ever taking the time to breathe? Huh? Can you tell me why we do it?
Why?
... For the mermaids.
My father used to see them everywhere too... but the only one he ever caught was my mother... Actually she caught him.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Why? Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
... So, between Mamma, Roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long. Except with Angelica. She just cries. And then finally, we all end up kissing. Can you explain that to me?
Because that's what love is all about. It's a pain in the ass but keeps us together. A large and beautiful family!
Enzo... We must quit the competition.
Why?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Huh? Well listen to him! Do you hear that?
No.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Listen to her! "That's what he's here for"! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you?
Two years younger than you.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks. How long can you hold your breath?
I don't know. Longer than you.
We'll see.
Take it easy...
Who won?
Won what? The Ass Hole Award? Well, let me tell you, it's a tie!
Acting like a pair of two year olds! You could have died in that damn pool!
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
My wallet.
It's still here.
No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Give it to me.
My real family... What kind of man has such a family?
I'm sick of never feeling at home anywhere.
Enzo, wake up!
Eh? Si! Avanti!
The medics are looking all over for you.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
Mr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but I cannot allow you to dive in such an advanced state of exhaustion.
What do you know about the sea? Huh? Nothing! So you just put your tubes and tin cans away. The sea is mine! I know when she is ready for me and when she isn't. And today, she is ready. Understand?
You dive at your own risk. You're been warned.
Brave.
You scared me!
Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... No?
No? Huh? Yes, of course!!
What's the matter?
Is she the new one?
How can you tell it's a female?
... The way she moves.
He's a dolphin specialist.
Not the way you mean.
It's going to cost you more than you think!
She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea.
How do you know that?
I don't know, I just feel it.
Ah! Jacques!
Don't be sad, I only took back what was mine.
Here, it's a present.
... Thank you.
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
Okay.
Tell me... Can you explain why you are soaking wet?
... We're in training.
Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be reasonable. Everyone is waiting for him upstairs. The photographers are there, the press...
He can't, he's indisposed.
Shall we call a doctor?
No, it's okay. Mamma is going to try something.
Mr. Mayol, help us. He refuses to receive his medal and everybody is waiting for him up there. We already have problems with the press because of the danger, and if we don't even have the divers help...!
... I'll do my best.
That's very kind of you.
It's Jacques... Mayol!
Jacques! My friend! Come on in!
Mr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to impress upon you the importance of your attending the Award Ceremony... For the press...
I think my brother told you I was indisposed, that should do it, no? I'm allowed to be indisposed, right? So, you just tell the press that the "big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by his inspiring descent to 324 feet, will not be able to receive this trinket because he is...
Because he is?!
Brave!
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Mamma! La pasta?!
Arrivo! Arrivo!
... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
... You always were the best.
Ah! La pasta!
Buon appetito, Signorina!
What's the matter? You still have a bunch of things to ask me? You want to know the price of tea in China of how we landed on the moon? Is that it?
No, I have to ask you a favor... You're the only one who'll understand.
... I'm listening.
Tutto va bene?
Gracie mille, chignora.
Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
You can't stay here! Come on! Go away!
You can stop that now, she has all the water she needs.
All right, we did it. Let's go back to the party.
Just one minute.
Jacques, the dolphin is home now. And that's where we're going. Come on! Hurry up now. Our girlfriend is freezing over there.
Well, good night, then...
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes...
... It's a comfortable place.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Good night.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Uh... Yes, of course!
You really do have a few things to learn about women!
What are they for?
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Yes... It's magic.
Tre minuti!
Due minuti!
Uno minuto!
The gueuse slides down the cable. JACQUES hangs on like a ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.
Jacques, listen to the applause.
Jacques, you set a world record.
I did?
Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Congratulations Jacques! It's wonderful! Wonderful!
I'm happy for you!
Here... Here...
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here!
Roberto's watch! I won it! He bet that you couldn't beat me!
You still collect them?
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch!
Is it a poem?
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare". You see I was right in getting you out here. You're a world champion, my friend!
It's a measuring tape.
You see this is your record, three feet more than mine! Looking at it from here, it doesn't look like much, does it?
Keep your little measuring tape, my friend, it will be a nice souvenir when I beat you next.
Jacques?
What are you doing here?
I'm going to leave, Jacques.
I'm going back home.
Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
I've got to get back to the hotel... and get my suitcase packed.
Will... will we see each other again?
Take good care of yourself, Jacques.
Where can I call you? Johana, tell me where can I call you?
Can I come in?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Wake me up at 11:00.
Hmmm! Something wrong?
Is it the girl?
Did she leave?
Hey! I'm going to take care of you! I've got this job, on an oil rig, no sweat! I'm taking you along... Come on! Get your bags packed! You're coming with me, I tell you!
We'll make a great team, the two of us. You'll see!
Mayol, Molinari...?
We've been waiting for you for three days. Goddamnit!
Is that the way you talk to the best diver in the world...? And to his friend Jacques Mayol!
Show them their quarters.
He doesn't like us.
So what!? His job is to hand out the paychecks. And he does that very well, let me tell you.
You still thinking about her?
Don't think about her anymore! Let me tell you, you're just making yourself unhappy! There are so many women in the world!
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
And where did you say you were from?
I didn't say... Brussels!
They're at 450 feet.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thank you.
Minus 800 feet. End of descent.
You have enough air for 15 minutes.
What's with the voice?
It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Try speaking to me?
I don't find this funny. We were having a serious conversation.
Here, give me your finger.
Is that alcohol? Are you out of your mind? Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Hey! D'you have any other complaints? Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Go on, suck your finger.
Are you crazy? At this pressure?
It's very deep down here.
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!
A thousand commanders and we get a Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.
ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first. He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables.
Can you hear me? What's going on? Are you sure you're on the right channel?
The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed to be working on. They have their arms around each other and are dancing.
If those guys are playing a radio down there they'd just better watch out!!
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales... or are you still over your limit?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No. I'm just depressed.
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
I know, I know! I'm a terrible person... It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good to be true.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going to do the trick this time.
It's serious, right?
I think so. You're pregnant... Congratulations! If that's in order?
It's in order! Thank you. Thank you.
I don't think it's me you have to thank.
Good afternoon.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes. Of course. Very wise.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have... One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
You're right. You're fired.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
He seems to have won it.
Yes, isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy. I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Bon appetit and Adieu!
Hello?
It's me... Johana.
How are you?
I got fired.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
It's getting light out.
Here, it's getting dark.
I've been thinking about you a lot, you know...
So have I. ... Hello?
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Then, tell me a story.
Uh... Ah! A story?
Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
No... tell me.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere. If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Hello?
It's me again.
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
Okay... huh, I'll be right over.
Are you okay?
... I think I love you.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You'll understand.
Someone in there?
Don't be afraid. It's my Uncle... Louis.
Assassin!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
No, no. Johana is visiting me.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Did you bring the cassettes, the Wagner, the Berlioz? This idiot never listens to anything I say. Sometimes I wonder if he isn't deaf.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Johana... New York.
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
He doesn't hear too well.
I said I was from New York.
That explains it! The best lays are from New York!
Uncle Louis!
No, no. It's true. When I was in New York, oh boy! Before my accident, you understand?
Uncle Louis! Johana is my friend. She's come to stay with me for a while.
Good. That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
Well... here.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Did you bring the cassettes?
You think it'll be all right? You'll be comfortable here?
It's going to be... interesting.
... It's not like him to be late. Of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all. Once in Capri, he...
We get the picture, Roberto. Jacques, I think Louis needs help.
Two dollars for this! This fish wasn't caught. It died of cancer!
Here he comes!
Jacques! Johana!
Enzo!
Enzo!
Where did you get that?
"That"! This is not a "that"... This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress. ... Who is going to be careful with the varnish... And who has come to spend a few days with us. Where's Mamma?
You have eight hours before she gets here.
He's really going totally deaf!
I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy! You take care of your eyes, I'll take care of my ears!
I'm sorry Uncle Louis.
Come on, drink up, my boy! It might just save us from your bullshit.
I'm glad you could come. I want you to meet Enzo.
So you're the famous Enzo Molinari?
In the flesh. I have that honor!
You're going to live here permanently?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes. Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Are you going to keep it?
Yes.
Does he know?
No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
And you...? Do you love Enzo?
Very much, I think. But, there's going to be a problem.
Mamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de pesci. Sono buoni.
Nothing. I'm not hungry.
Mamma, Bonita is an actress like Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani...
Sarah Bernardt. I sing too... a hell of a Carmen. Want to hear?
No thank you.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
The whale! How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
That's different! What's the matter with you?
Mamma, pesce di spada?
Hey, whale! Can you pass down the squids?
A shit dive.
Those goddamned frogmen doctors waiting around at 200 feet they just kill your concentration.
They're required by law.
There's no law down there! The only law is what your lungs can take. ... Have fun! They waiting for you down there, to take the temperature of your ass.
Anybody can have a bad day!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know? Go do your Hindu exercises and don't break my balls!
Well, how was it?
Enzo had a bad day.
And you?
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.
You forgot your magazine!
What?
... Nothing.
Let them try.
I wanted to say goodbye, Johana.
You're leaving?
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.
Of course.
It's no use... Just tell him I said goodbye... And give him a kiss for me, Okay?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Good huh?
He really was unbelievable, 328 feet, deeper than the world record... ... And, Jacques! He held his breath for four minutes and fifty seconds!
Good... I guess I have tomorrow's work cut out for me as Enzo would say...
You must be very careful, Jacques. At these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is... You'd really be pushing it. I think it's very, very dangerous.
Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
Thank you, thank you very much!
... Now I'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue. Dangerous, because we don't know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet.
But, we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition continue!
Good luck to you all!
Fabulous, what a dive, huh?
He's right. What's the point of knocking yourself out?
What are you doing?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
JACQUES dives down very fast. The control takes place at 200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go. He continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker around him.
360 feet! He dove 360 feet!!!
... There's a party at the hotel tonight.
That's good.
Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
I'll see you in Amorgos.
Jacques...?
You go back, I'll walk.
I won today. I dove very deep, Tina.
What's so funny? Can you dive deeper?
So you understand everything?
That's good... So tell me why they're all angry at me? Why is Enzo angry? I never wanted to compete with him. I never wanted to be champion of anything... All I want is to escape from them all... For just a few minutes, no people... No noise... Nothing but the sea.
Do you really understand me? Huh? Are we actually having a conversation here?
All right then, tell me can I ever dive as deep as you? Stay under as long...?
Are you sure?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
What's wrong?
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water?
Is he here?
He's training.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about. Why do you and Jacques risk your lives diving?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Because you'd laugh.
I won't, I swear.
I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him. To me, the sea is a religion... That surprises you, doesn't it?
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
He can learn. He is learning.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
... Not yet.
Don't.
Why?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
That idiot!
Is he alright? What happened?
The fool was asleep! If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with? Well, good luck! You better learn to look after him because I won't always be here to do it!
... How long was I asleep?
Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I'll never let you take away my title. D'you hear me? Never!
Do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be?
... Sure.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
... You should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. Very good the piano! Tomorrow is going to be a big day!
... When I analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became apparent... ... At the depths these men are diving, it is a physiological impossibility that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it back to the surface. It's a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom, orient themselves and to return... To attempt to break Mayol's record is simple suicide. For the last time. I'm telling you cancel the competition.
Get Mayol in here.
Enzo? Enzo... I know you're angry at me. Enzo, it's important.
I'm concentrating.
We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
You say that because you have the title!
No! I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
You were right.
... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Just give him five minutes! What does it matter now, anyway... Come on, just leave him alone!
Take this. Have a good sleep.
Sweet dreams.
Kiss me.
Sleep now. We'll talk later.
I've packed all of... Enzo's clothes. I'm going to the radio telephone... ... to call Mamma.
I'll go see how he's doing.
Let him sleep.
Jacques... Are you alright?
Jacques? Are you alright? Answer me! Are you alright?
You've got to tell me what happened?
I saw how it has to be.
Jacques, you know I love you.
Don't be sad... It's not because of you, it's me. It's all going on inside me! I've gotta go and see.
See what? There is nothing to see! It's pitch black down there! It's cold. You'll be all alone! Look at me, Jacques! I am here! I exist! Look!!! I'm real! I am not a dream! Jacques will you look at me? Please!
Jacques? I'm pregnant.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
You are the father.
I lied... to keep you here.
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of the gueuse. He has a beautiful smile on his face. He is in his element. Night has closed in around him. He turns on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light around him.
JACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever. He has gained a lot of speed.
The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable. JACQUES turns his body right side up.
The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of light. He stays there, patiently floating around and around his cable... as if he were waiting for something.
It's over ...
It's one of these.
We're going to freeze to death.

Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought -
Ah!
Success.
Well. This is it.
It smells damp.
It's just been empty a while.
Besides, it's an old house.
How long since you were here?
The best part of ten years.
I wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old Lady died, but I couldn't get Frank to agree.
Christ. It's not been touched.
Look at this.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You mean we're moving in?
You don't like it?
It's better than Brooklyn.
You're still blaming me.
No. I'm not.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia ...
Shit.
Larry!
I hear you.
Where are you?
In here.
Squatters?
Frank.
He's here?
He's been here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
Hello ...?
Is there anybody there?
There's nobody there -
I'm surprised it's even connected ...
Who's there?
Daddy?

I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
I said I found a room.
No Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
No, no. Not just yet. It needs ... er ... some work.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Great.
Maybe tomorrow. I got to go look for a job.
I love you too.
Well?
Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.
We're not going to get it in.
Tip it! Tip it!
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
It'll go in.
Famous last fucking words.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
How are you doing through there?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Got any beer?
There's some in the 'fridge.
I'll get it.
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
Not much.
Dad?
Honey!
Big house.
You like?
Me like.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Is Julia here?
Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Suprise.
Kirsty.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Kitchen's through on your left
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Oh.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Can I come in?
Can I come in?
Shit! Shit!
Are you O.K.?
Sure.
the person who opened the door. It's JULIA; a younger JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes brighter. It is two weeks before her marriage to LARRY. She looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face.
You're Julia, right?
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
I came for the wedding.
Oh. Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
That's nice to know. Have you got a towel?
Have you got a towel?
Kirsty.
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bath- room.
Which is where?
Just to your left.
Did Dad tell you I got a room, by the way? Waterloo. Centre of the known universe.
Have you got it?
I've got it. I told you -
Wait! Wait!
Well?
But you said -
I don't want to see the dress.
You know what I want.
I want you.
FRANK. He is not so beraggled as in the first scene, but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face. Standing half in shadow he looks almost dangerous.
That's better
What about Larry -
Forget him.
Slowly, will you? Slowly!
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh Frank ...
Will you take the weight while I take a step up?
Christ!
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
You fucking ass-holes.
Who are you calling a fucking ass-hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
... Oh Christ ...
... oh ... Christ ...
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
He's fucked off.
Eh ... LANGUAGE.
Sorry. He's gone upstairs. So we're fucking off too.
Will you sign for the bed?
Sure.
... Julia ...
What have you done?
I cut myself.
Is it deep?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
Let me see.
It's probably going to need stitches.
I'm going to throw up.
No, you're not.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
What happened?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Sure.
The keys are in the kitchen.
the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats. She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk.
- always hated the sight of my own blood. I go out like a light. Anybody else's? no problem. But mine ... you know ... goes straight to my head. Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not. Next thing I know -
- I wake up On the floor.
I should do it!
Doctors -
I know. And he's saying I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Right ... Anyone for more?
No ... no ... I ...
Come on, you're only young once -
What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.
Steve?
We're on the Cointreau.
That's right. Cointreau.
I'll do it.
I won't be able to stand.
So lie down.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you O.K.?
Bill? Absolutely not. Sit down. We've got celebrating to do.
It was a wonderful meal.
Oh it was. It was wonderful.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
See you again soon.
Yes. You must. We're so happy you're back.
That's nice. Well ... goodnight.
Does it still hurt?
Only when I laugh.
Who's there?
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said don't look.
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
No. God no.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
His blood ... on the floor ... It brought me back.
Back from where?
Just help, will you? Please God, help me -
You're not going?
Just upstairs.
Need any help?
I AM house-trained.
No ... I meant ...
It's round on the left -
I know.
... somebody ...
Ssh!
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
What do you want me to do.
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back ...
You have to heal me.
Hello?
Oh, it's you.
Kirsty?
I'm here.
I thought we'd lost you.
I'm coming! Sleep well.
You know I do know the way home.
It's late.
Not that late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right. No. That's nice.
If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?
We walk.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
She's so damn ... English.
Meaning what?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
I beg your pardon?
There ya go. I beg your pardon?
We're not all frigid.
Oh no?
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Well?
Yes.
In a moment.
Hey, sex-bomb -
You keep your - Oh. Hi.
I just called in. How about tonight?
I don't finish till twelve.
I'm a late riser.
Catch you later.
Not much fun, is it?
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe ...
Why not?
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch- time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh? One soda, one whisky. I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
That depends.
Oh?
You know it's not often I ... you know ...
There's a first time for every- thing.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Oh, come on. It's what you brought me here for, isn't it?
Yes. I just think we'd be better off upstairs.
Oh. Oh fine.
This your place?
Let's not talk about it.
No personal details, right?
Right.
You know, you're incredible -
Come on in. Make yourself at home.
There's no bed.
That's right.
Huh?
I prefer the floor.
First time for everything, right?
Right.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Yeah, why don't I?
Why don't you do the same?
Maybe I will.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Am I?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
Oh Christ.
What's wrong?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
I'll be a moment.
The door's stuck.
Don't ... I ... please ... I'm sorry ...
Enough?
Don't look at me.
Jesus Christ.
Do I disgust you?
See? It's making me whole again.
Come to Daddy. I only want to touch ...
Sweetheart?
Where are you?
Are you there?
Who's a pretty boy then?
Julia?
Are you there?
Julia?
I'm here.
Sweetheart ... I've been calling you.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Oh, babe ...
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute

Frank?
I'm hurting
Hurting.
My nerves ... are beginning to work again.
Good.
One more. Maybe two -
Who?
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Julia? Are you all right?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?

Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Keep your voice down.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
You're hurting.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse ...

What are you doing?
Christ. What was that about?
I'm O.K., honey. It's all right ...
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Never better. You sleep well.
I love you, honey.
Who was it?
Kirsty.
Kirsty.
Quite sure.
Well?
Better. Much better. I'd like some clothes. And maybe a cigarette.
Then you tell me ... you explain what happened to you?
Of course.
I wanted access to experiences ... pleasures ... that only they could offer ...
The Cenobites.
That's what they call themselves. They're not human. Maybe they were once, but they're not now. They rearrange their own flesh for pleasure.
And the box?
It cost me a fortune. All I had. It's a puzzle you see. You solve it, and the Cenobites come through ...
Where from?
God knows. Sometimes I think they're just behind the walls ...
So they cheated you
Oh no. They kept to their bargain. They gave me experiences I'd never forget ...
But their pleasure was my pain.
Terrible pain. Appalling ...
And the blood let you out?
There are ways to resurrection. Blood's one of them. I won't let them take me back, Julia.
I want to be whole, and then get out -
You won't have to. We'll be gone. Somewhere they'll never find us.
Is this upsetting you?
I've seen worse.
Are you all right?
Fine.
Only I'll turn it off -
What was that?
Thunder.
No. Something else.
Maybe I left a window open -
No. I'll do it.
It was nothing.
What's wrong with you?
I just hate the thunder.
I'm here.
Oh baby.
Don't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please ...
Don't.
We must have rats.
See? Quite safe.
... oh babe ...
...I love you, honey ... let me ... oh God ... I love you ...
Oh baby ... I love you ...
... no ...
No. No, you mustn't. PLEASE. No.
Huh?
Please ...
What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it ...
I don't understand you. One moment you're all over me, the next it's Don't touch me.
... maybe we should never have come back.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
She's not like Mom. She's ... I don't know ... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
You don't like her at all do you?
I don't know her. She's so ... sealed up.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
What?
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
Would you ... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Sure.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
You can't love him.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
I get lonely sometimes.
Everybody does.
Come in.
What is this? A game?
Christ help me!
Don't!
No!
Get out of here.
Please ... don't let him kill me ... please ...
Oh my God.
Julia!
Kirsty?
Keep your fucking distance. Julia! Where's Julia? Christ, what have you done with her.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
No.
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
No. Get the fuck off me.
You've grown. You're beautiful.
Don't touch me. Or so help me -
What? What will you do? What can you do? There's nothing to be frightened of.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
This isn't happening.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ...
Give that to me.
No.
One last time. Give me the box.
You want it?
NO!
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
Some things have to be endured ...
You're awake.
So ... you're back with us.
I think so.
How are you feeling?
Tender.
You took quite a beating. Do you remember what happened?
I want to speak to my father ...
Of course. We'll bring you a telephone.
Why not?
Chin up. There's no serious damage. And you're safe here.
Um.
She'll tell them everything ...
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave -
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here -
I need a skin. Then we leave -
Comfortable?
Sure.
Any luck with your father?
He's probably got a meeting. I called a friend of mine. He's coming; is that O.K.?
Of course.
Julia?
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin ...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for your- self -
Where the hell did you come from?
The box ... you opened it. We came.
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us - it's called the Lament Con- figuration.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
We can't. Not alone.
This isn't for real.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
Don't touch me!
Steve. Thank God you came.
What happened to you?
These THINGS ... they want to take me -
What things?
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No!
What's wrong?
Don't let them take me, Steve -
I won't let anybody take you.
If he takes another step, we open his throat.
Please go, Steve.
What?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me -
What did I say?
Will you GO, damn you?
I'll come back later, huh?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
'Bye.
Good.
It's time we were away.
Let me alone, will you?
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
Wait!
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
Oh yes.
But he escaped you.
Nobody escapes us.
HE did. I've seen him. He's alive.
Is that so? And what are you proposing?
I'll take you to him. Then you take him instead of me. Back wherever you come from.
Perhaps ...
But if you cheat us ...
We'll tear your soul apart!
She was trembling all over.
I'd better go look for her.
Maybe she's gone back to her -
- father.
Please! Dad! It's me! It's Kirsty!
Damn her.
Please, answer me! Please -
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
Oh God. Thank God. I thought something might have ...
Of course.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right ...
No. You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house. And he's -
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
He's gone.
Gone?
Dead.
He was insane, baby a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -
... we'll tear your soul apart ...
I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger. Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows I don't really understand myself. Did he hurt you?
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Show her.
LARRY, still sitting at the table. His fingers drum a familiar tattoo. Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel Bogey'.
Where are you going?
You leave this to us, you hear me? We'll deal with the police -
Where are you going?
I have to get out.
Stay with me -
- it's all right. Really it is ...
I can't stay.
Come to Daddy.
Come to Daddy.
No, damn you -
Oh my God.
Frank!
You're not leaving now -
Help me, Frank. For God's sake.
No, Frank -
Where are you, beautiful?
Where are you, honey?
Come to Daddy.
What are you doing here?
Got in downstairs. Looking for you. What's going on?
You forgot something -
I'll go first -
God -
Don't cry for him. He's dead. He always was.
Go on. Kill me. I don't care.
Poor baby.
You bastard
Hush now. It's all right. Frank's here.
Frank.
That's right. Are you losing your mind, baby? This is Frank you're talking to. FRANK.
What's going on?
Frank -
What took you so long?
We had to hear it from his own lips -
You set me up! You bitch. You set me up!
This isn't for your eyes.
Out!
Bitch!
We have to get out of here. They'll kill us for the fun of it.
Don't leave us yet -
We've got such sights to show you -
... don't ...
Jesus Christ.
Kirsty ...
Julia?
Don't!
Come on! Come on!
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Come to Daddy!
Not tonight.
Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window. Jo's interest seems only casual.
Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa before? It looks familiar.
Jo studies the landscape.
We saw the same scenery last summer driving to Las Vegas.
Oh sure. Where daddy lost all that money at the cr --
Hank!
-- table.
Hey look - a camel!
Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.
This isn't really Africa, Hank. It's French Morocco.
Northern Africa.
Still seems like Las Vegas.
We're only a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert!
I dunno. In school they called it the Dark Continent. It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!
Just wait till you see Marrakesh.
Marrakesh. Sounds like a drink.
You bet it does.
Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank grows, restless. He looks about for something to do. Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes. Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the bus and test its possibilities for adventure.
The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,
With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the woman's veil.
The woman still covers her face, but from the seat next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank, repeating his demand.
People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the reason for the trouble.
The Arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy in furious Arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.
Two Arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats apparently disturbed by what the brown-clothed Arab is saying. They being talking among themselves.
Ben and his wife, Jo, are straining from their back seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong. Ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating that Hank is involved.
Still staring straight at the Arab, both frightened and fascinated by his verbal attack, Hank retreats.
Except for the French passengers, everyone in the bus is in a state of disturbance. The Arab continues to advance on Hank keeping up a steady tirade of Arabic.
Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his son and the oncoming Arab.
Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother, still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's benefit.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Simmer down.
From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the Arab. He pushes in between the pair.
Pardon me.
The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats, growing quiet.
Hank and Jo relax. Ben addresses the Frenchman, a pleasant-looking young man. He is LOUIS BERNARD.
I'd like to thank you. Without your help, anything might have happened.
A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
May I introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.
How do you do, madame. My name is Louis Bernard.
Thank you, Mr. Bernard.
And this is our son, Hank.
Hallo, Hank.
You talk Arab talk.
A few words.
Why was he so angry? It was an accident.
The Moslem religion allows for few accidents. May I be permitted to sit down?
Oh, sure, sure. 0f course. Next to Jo, there.
I thought his name was Hank.
Oh, uh --
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 7.
That's my wife's name. Jo. Jay oh. No "e."
Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In the rear windows behind them we see the retreating landscape of French Morocco.
How different.
For Josephine. Called her Jo so long, nobody knows her by any other name.
I do. Mummy.
Now about the "accident." You see, a Moslem woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.
They feed her intervaneously?
Quite a big word for such a small boy.
I'm a doctor.
Oh. Well, he sounds like one.
He can spell "haemoglobin" -- but he has trouble with "cat" and "dog."
And where do you practice, Doctor?
Indianapolis, Indiana. The Good Samaritan.
Jo seems to be studying Bernard, as if puzzled.
What brings you to Marrakesh?
Ben seems happy to talk with somebody new.
We've been to a medical convention in Paris. And while we were in Europe, I thought I'd like to see Morocco again.
Daddy liberated Africa.
I was up around Casablanca with an Army field hospital, that's all.
Jo his been listening. She seems annoyed at Louis Bernard's questioning. She interrupts.
Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?
He smiles at her.
Oh no. I suppose you came directly from Paris?
We looked in on Rome and Lisbon a few days.
And Casablanca.
I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakesh.
At the most we'll have three days.
You will naturally be stopping at the hotel Mamounia or La Menara?
Why?
They are hotels for tourists of good taste.
It moves through the outskirts of Marrakesh, a somewhat more populated section, although the streets are narrow and crowded.
Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?
Sometimes.
Do you eat snails.
When I'm lucky enough to got them.
If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails.
Thank you for the invitation.
That's all right. We tried everything to got rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman.
Next time take the train.
Would you like to share our taxi to the hotel?
That's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first.
What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?
However, I'll be there later - perhaps we might have a drink together.
All right. But I'll serve the drinks in our suite.
In that case, I will take you to dinner.
No. Now that's not a fair bargain.
But I know Marrakesh. I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic.
Well -- that's what we came here for. Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian Nights?
Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade.
You'll do.
How would you prefer to travel to the hotel? By taxi? Fiacre?
A wagon! I want to ride in a wagon!
Au revoir. I look forward to cocktails.
Goodbye.
See you later. And thinks again.
I don't like people who pat me on the head.
The carriage awaits, madame.
How do you like this! A horse-drawn convertible!
Hold on. Hold on! Here we go!
Ben -- I just saw Louis Bernard talking to that Arab.
What Arab?
The one who was shouting at Hank for taking the woman's veil. He and the Frenchman were talking like old friends.
All right. Let's assume they knew each other, and Louis Bernard didn't bother to tell us. What does that mean?
It means Mr. Bernard is a very mysterious man.
He struck me as quite normaL
What do you know about him?
I know his name...and, uh....
You see? And he knows you' re an American living in Indianapolis, Indiana. A doctor at the Good Samaritan. You have a garden with snails, a wife, a boy who can spell haemoglobin. You went to a medical convention in Paris. Stopped at Rome, Lisbon, Casablanca. You once served in North Africa with an Army field Hospital --
Now hold on. Wait a minute. We were just talking casually...
Not talking.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 14.
He was asking, you were telling. You might as well have handed him your passport.
What difference does it make? I have nothing to hide.
Maybe Mr. Bernard has.
Jo. I know this is mysterious Morocco. Inscrutable natives gliding through twisted, narrow streets, but --
Oh, Ben!
Then relax. You're just mad because he didn't ask any questions about you.
Bitter medicine, doctor. But I'll swallow it.
Well. This eases the pain.
What pain, mummy?
Just an expression.
Will you take care of the driver?
My name is McKenna, Doctor McKenna.
Est-ce que vous etes libre? Jevous prend.
We're being watched.
Oh come on.
In the single room occupied by Hank. Jo is putting his clothes away. Hank, having brushed his teeth and rinsed his mouth, emerges from the bathroom. He wears pajamas, but still has his shoos on.
How about it, mummy? One chorus.
I'm a little out of form, Hank.
One chorus, and that's all.
All right, Mr. Hammerstein. What's your pleasure?
Quo Sera Sera. Like you and Alfred Drake. I'll be Alfred Drake.
What's your key?
Whatever I happen to hit.
How's that?
Pretty original.
Let's go.
When I was lust a little boy I asked my mother "What will I be?" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me:
Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera What will be will be Que Sera Sera.
Louis Bernard looks up with some surprise, fascinated and delighted with Jo's singing ability.
Ben, who is putting on his tie, pauses, and listens. There is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on his face. Hank's voice comes over:
When I was just a child in school I asked my teacher "What should I try" Should I paint pictures? Should I sing songs? This was her wise reply:
Jo does a turn, takes Hank's hand and he does a turn around her as she sings.
Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera! Whatever will be will be Que Sera Sera!
Now I have children of my own They ask their mother "What will I be?" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? I tell them tenderly:
There goes our sock finish!
Right in there.
I can't tell you how beautifully your wife sings.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
She's marvelous. Too bad it was interrupted.
I've had the same feeling. Often.
He said the manager is going to send up somebody to baby sit.
Good.
Mrs. McKenna, permit me the pleasure of serving you a drink.
Thank you.
Were you on the American stage, Mrs. McKenna?
Jo turns, and gives Ben a meaningful glance. "The Frenchman is asking questions again."
Ben gives her a look of comic disparagement.
Louis comes up, hands her a martini.
Madame.
Thank you. Let's sit where it's cool.
Yes, I was on the American stage, and the London stage, and even the Paris stage.
Oh?
I thought you might have seen me in Paris -- being French, and --
The theater, requires time, and for me time is often a luxury.
Have you ever been to Paris, Mr. Bernard?
I was born there.
What do you do for a living?
Buy and sell.
What?
Whatever gives the best profit.
Just what are you buying, or selling, now in Marrakesh?
You know, I would much rather talk about the stage. If you tell me what to answer any?
I'll answer it.
The CAMERA PANS Jo past Ben to the door. He has just put on his coat, and turns to follow her to the door. She opens it, and standing in the corridor is a silhouetted figure. We cannot see the face. Jo switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious looking man of medium height standing there.
Excusez moi, mais is cherche la chambre do Monsieur Montgomery.
As the McKennas turn, the man in the doorway lifts himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in the direction of Louis Bernard.
The man immediately turns his attention back to Ben, and begins talking in broken English.
I am inquiring for the room of a Monsieur Montgomery. He asked me for a drink, and l --
Sorry, there's no Montgomery here.
Then pardon me, monsieur, I regret disturbing you.
It's all right.
The McKennas turn back to the room. Louis Bernard's face his changed slightly to the more serious. Hank's voice is heard off:
Mummy -- I can't cut this meat!
I'll do it, Hank.
May I use your telephone?
I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go to dinner with you tonight.
The headwaiter bows slightly.
Good evening. My name is McKenna.
They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.
The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions directly behind those of the two people who stared at them.
Ben...
Sit down, Jo, please. People are staring at us.
You're right. People are staring at us.
What people?
They stared at us when we went into the hotel.
Jo, will you stop imagining things?
Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind him also turns. They are staring directly at each other.
Good evening.
You must think me awfully rude. I've been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel.
You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?
Yes, I am.
Didn't I tell you? I knew I was right.
Another angle, featuring the man, and Ben.
I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband.
How do you do, sir!
How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs. McKenna.
My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago.
Of course we hardly ever see a show. Edward is such an old stick-in-the- mud. So I have to console myself with your records.
And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not one for this terrible Bee Bop or whatever you call it.
Thank you, Mr. Drayton.
When are you coming back to London?
Possibly never again, professionally.
Don't tell me you've given up the stage.
Temporarily.
It's just that I'm a doctor... Yes. And a doctor's wife...
What Ben means is that there are no Broadway musical shows produced in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if we lived in New York... ...where I hear doctors aren't starving...
I have nothing against working in New York. Nothing except the fact that it's very hard for my patients to come all the way from Indianapolis for treatment.
Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying the wrong thing.
Not the least, Mrs. Drayton.
Tell me; Dr. McKenna do you always.....
Do you think we could get straightened around.
We now find the Draytons and the McKennas are sitting in a group, eating dinner together. There is no back to back awkwardness. All are busily tearing whole roast chickens apart with their bare fingers. Drayton holds a piece of chicken aloft, demonstrating the proper Arab method of eating.
Only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand. Never use the smaller fingers. And always keep the left hand in the lap.
Does it have something to do with religion?
More social than religious, I'd say.
It seems to me if you have four good fingers, and a thumb, you should use them all.
Three finger -- four fingers -- for my money this is nothing but chicken in the rough. We have it at every drive- in back home.
Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy farming my bit of land It Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from the United Nations started worrying me.
Edward was a big noise at the Ministry of Food during the war, you know.
So, I pulled myself up by the roots, and here we are. United Nations Relief.
That sounds like interesting work.
You should see my report on soil erosion in Morocco... But nobody reads it.
Trouvez nous un coin tranquille -- C'est possible?
As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.
Well just what do you think of that? First he promises to take us to dinner --
Look, we only met him today. We can't expect him to change his whole life --
Oh, Ben! What's the matter with you?!
Nothing! What's the matter with you?!
I just don't like to be both privately and publicly insulted.
Can you blame him? Turning down an old married couple for a date with a girl like that?
We're not an old married couple! All right -- He's a heel. I don't understand him -- and I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.
I must do some shopping in the market tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine. Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I how our English weather is awful, but I sometimes think we don't know when we're lucky. All this sunshine, day after day. It seems unnatural, somehow.
I want to get up.
Ben, I know you -- once you get worked up, you'll start a fight. Now please, sit down and forget him.
By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd let us show you round the market place, tomorrow.
Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us through the market tomorrow.
Good. I'll just go over and cancel out.
Ben, don't. Our dinner's getting cold. We'd love to go with you.
I don't know why Ben gets so worked up over unimportant things.
Over in the far corner of the restaurant, the lady with Louis Bernard leans forward and murmurs something in French. Her gaze is across the room in the direction of the McKennas.
Oui.
A closer view of the shoppers -- veiled women, men on bicycles, carts and donkeys passing.
The water sellers move slowly through the market, their large hats tinkling with gay sounding bells.
The medicine man sitting among his medical wares -- Ben and Jo enter and look down at the collection of claws, lizards, and barnyard scrapings.
Looks like he has a cure for everything.
Yeah, there's a lot of that going around these days.
Woman with sewing machine on head.
The bread vendors offering large fresh-baked loaves of bread. Scattered among the native populace are some tourists and perhaps some French residents.
Mr. Drayton is standing by an Arab who has a small gambling table set up, possibly roulette, There are others gambling. After a moment's hesitation, and a look around to see that he is safe from Mrs. Drayton, he chances a small bet. He loses.
An old man squatting on his heels and surrounded by a small circle of onlookers is reading from a book. His voice intones monotonously. The CAMERA PANS to the RIGHT and we see Hank McKenna standing watching him. Hank is holding on to Mrs. Drayton's hand.
What's he doing, Mrs. Drayton?
He's the teller of tales, Hank. He reads legends and famous old stories from history.
Wish he'd say something I could understand.
A larger group of people who are gathered around some acrobats who are performing rather well.
Standing on the fringe of the crowd watching the acrobats are the McKennas.
Ben, I'm glad we came here. It's different, a little exciting.
Wouldn't you rather be in Now York -- rehearsing?
Oh, all that talk last night was just social chit chat, Every woman who ever gave up the stage for marriage is supposed to want to go back. I was just playing a part expected of me.
Well, if you do -- let's talk about it -- seriously.
No, if at all, let's talk about it humorously.
Mummy! Daddy!
Come on with us! We're gonna see the medicine man! Maybe you on learn something, Daddy.
You're probably right.
Any time he starts wearing you out --
I've never enjoyed the market place so much. Oh!
Come on!
Standing on the fringe of the crowd watching the acrobats are the McKennas.
Ben, this whole market place is very different and exciting.
Just like the county fairs when I was a kid. They'd get everything but the balloon ascension.
That didn't sound too hilarious to me.
I was just thinking...do you know what's paying for these three days in Marrakesh?
And the purse I bought in Paris...
Mummy! Daddy!
Come on with us! We're gonna see the medicine man! Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.
You're probably right.
Any time he starts wearing you out...
I don't know whether or not to believe you.
Ben, glamour is a costume I put on once. It never fit too well. I'd rather live my own life than one written for me.
Including sleeping with a man who always smells of ether?
I don't have to look seductive at breakfast and worry if the Times reviewer doesn't like my scrambled eggs.
How are the acrobats today?
Oh fine, fine. Haven't dropped anybody yet.
The CAMERA DOLLIES along beside them as they pass down a line of Arab barbers all busily engaged with shaving and cutting the hair of their customers.
All the way home we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcors.
And Allida Markle's asthma.
Oh, I know it's just a song and a dance here and there... but it's all he thinks about. Show business.
Ben, you're setting a trap for me.
He has a good mind. Give him a chance to develop it.
You mean give him a change to be a doctor?
I didn't say that.
The CAMERA PANNING through the market place to a line of veiled women all working at Singer sewing machines. Drayton saunters behind them in the distance. Jo holds out her hand for Ben to shake it.
All right, darling, a deal's a deal.
For every time step he'll learn a new muscle -- and for every chorus, three bones.
And for every matinee?
Two chapters of Grey's Anatomy.
Hey, Mummy. Sewing machines! Looks like a television commercial.
Now If we could only get four cases of the Seven-year itch, we could retire. Or, if Mrs. Yarros really has triplets, we could at least redecorate the house.
Oh, Ben, what would they say if they heard us?
The CAMERA PANNING through the market place to a line of veiled women all working at Singer sewing machines. Drayton saunters behind them in the distance.
One of the reasons I came to a place like Marrakesh is so that we could say things like this without anybody hearing us.
I'd like to say something where nobody can hear us.
This is the safest place.
When are we going to have another child?
You're the doctor. You have all the answers.
Yeah -- but, but this is the first time I've heard the question!
Hey, Mummy. Sewing machines! Looks like a television commercial.
Having a good time, Hank?
He's delighted with everything.
Hank, fascinated at the drama, dishes away to got a better view.
Hank! Hank -- come back here!
Hank!
Mrs. Drayton reaches down and takes hold of Hank's shoulders, and pulls him toward her.
Hank, it's best to keep away from trouble.
What's going on?
It looks as though the police are chasing somebody.
A closer view of the chase brings us back to where the motor coaches are loading up, and for a moment the police as lost to view.
A high view of the open air tannery with its circles of crude stone water tanks becomes the scene of a further part of the chase. We see the white-robed Arab leaping between the crude tanks with the police yelling and running after him in the distance. The difficulty of the obstacles enables the Arab to get ahead of them, and we see that he is now able to dodge through an archway into the grain market.
As the chase passes through the grain market, it scatters grain and grain sellers in every direction.
The pursued Arab dashes through an enclosure holding the donkeys which are used to carry grain to and from the market. There is quite a stampede, with the donkeys running, kicking, and braying in fright.
Through another archway the Arab now dashes down some of the narrow streets of the Medina. Sapling branches are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern on the ground below.
As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the police in pursuit, progress is made difficult by the many shoppers and bicycle riders. One bicycle rider trying to avoid the oncoming Arab turns and drives helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of wreckage is enormous.
The Arab turns into another street where the rows of brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder. In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab continues on past. The police dash through the street trying to avoid the dye themselves.
The Police reach a narrow intersection where the blind beggars as squatting, begging alms. They pause. There is no sign of their quarry. Then one of them points to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left. They take up the pursuit once again.
A high, overhead shot of the narrow streets showing that the police have caught sight of their man again. But there seems to be something strange about the chase now. Two white-robed Arabs are running. The second Arab we haven't seen before, but he is faster than the first man and is gaining on him.
A closer, level shot, the CAMERA PANNING, shows, the two breathless men closing in on each other. As they reach an intersection in the streets, lighted by a shaft of sunlight, the new Arab comes up behind the original man being chased and whipping out a knife from under his robes, plunges it into the back of the first man. Then he turns and quickly moves away into a street on his left. The first Arab jerks his head up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing, Then he staggers into the dark shadows.
A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out of sight for a moment so that the police continue their chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted down another side turning.
The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands, vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM as he staggers out into the open market place. His shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and shoulders as he attempts to go forward.
The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his group.
The Arab hesitates for a moment, but the attitude of his head shows us that he has seen McKenna. He makes his way desperately and painfully toward him. He is finding it difficult to remain upright and even take those last few steps.
A closer view of McKenna shows that those around him, including his wife and the Draytons, become frightened. He spreads his arms out to move them back protectively, waiting to see what is going to happen.
As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's cheeks.
Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better. The Arab gasps out something in French.
Ils ont trouvés... ils ont réussi à trouver...
McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard.
Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with one arm and grabs Ben by the coat.
McKenna -- listen to me -- first!
A man...a statesman...is to be killed...assassinated...in London...soon...very soon...tell them...in London...to try Ambrose Chappell...
As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly withdraws. Ben rises.
Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes out a pen.
Ben -- who is he?
Louis Bernard. Got something to write on?
Is he dead?
Yes. Yes. He's dead.
Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the pen. Before either man can comment on the writing, the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French.
The policeman repeats his question as he stops in front of Ben.
Il ne parle pas francais. Je traduirái.
He wants to find out if you know this man.
Of course we know him! It's the frenchman, Louis Bernard.
McKenna.
Just as I thought. He wants both of you to go to police headquarters to make a statement.
Do we have to?
I'm afraid so. Our friends here have to go to the police Station. I'm going with them to give what help I can.
Mrs. Drayton comes up to the group, still holding on to Hank's hand.
You don't want your little boy to go, do you?
I wanna go. I never saw a French police station before.
Perhaps it would be best if I took him back to the hotel.
You're very thoughtful.
I think we'd better set off. Heaven knows how long we shall be.
The McKenna's are walking across the square with the Police and Drayton a few yards behind them. The CAMERA MOVES with them. Jo moves close to Ben and speaks to him in a surreptitious manner.
Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab- outfit, wearing makeup?
What's more important -- why was he killed?
I'll bet he was a spy, or something like that.
Ben, what did he whisper to you? What did you write down?
I'll tell you later.
What is it?
I don't feel very good after what I said about Louis Bernard last night.
Once we talk to the police inspector, I'll do my best to out some of the red tape.
I have to stretch.
I'm afraid the questions will go on till doomsday, if you admit knew this chap Bernard before.
I didn't know him at all. We only met yesterday on a bus.
They're a cynical lot, these French -- they might refuse to believe that.
They'll have to believe me. It's true.
It might sound a bit odd, from their point of view. They saw the poor chap whispering to you ... and then they saw you writing something down...
The question is, are you going to show them what you wrote down?
Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m'ont demandé de traduire.
Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary. Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame?
Do to the kindness to wait. I might have questions for you later.
Your passports, please.
You entered French Morocco four days ago.
That's right.
You are a doctor, monsieur?
A surgeon. A tourist, and an American citizen.
Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
I didn't have.
You were recently in Paris?
A medical convention.
You come to Marrakesh with him in the same bus. You drank an apéritif with him in your hotel room. And you ate at the same restaurant last night.
But at different tables.
So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
I met him yesterday -- on the bus -- for the first time in my life.
And yet -- out of five thousand people -- In a great market place -- he comes to you when he is about to die! Is that the action of a casual acquaintance, monsieur?
I know nothing about Louis Bernard.
No? Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Déuxieme Bureau?
What's that?
Perhaps you have also never head of the American F.B.I.? It would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.
Now, look here...
The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. That is why he was kill-ed. He told you what he had discovered. Why? Because he placed complete confidence in you. Voila.
Boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them -- Wait a minute let me ask you a question.
Indeed, Monsieur?
Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would I?
Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence?
Let's get something straight. I'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. I somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. I came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling.
Monsieur, I would like....
Now hold your horses! Just hold them.
Laissez nous, nous sommes occuppes.
Wait a minute. A telephone call for me?
Where?
Mais enfin, voyons!
I'll take the call now. You just take it easy.
Madame McKenna.
I don't know a thing,
Hello.
This is McKenna. Who's calling me?
Hello.
Drayton!
Didn't your wife say she was taking Hank straight back to the hotel?
As I recall. Why?
Call her. Somebody just threatened me about Hank. See if he's all right.
Passez moi l'hôtel Mamounia, s'il vous plait. Voulez vous appeler la chambre deux cents dix sept s'il vous plait.... je vois, Puis-je parler au, concierge?...Ah! ici Mr. Drayton de la chambre deux cents dix sept. Est ce que ma femme est revenue a l'hôtel depuis une heure? Sa chambre ne répond pas.... je vois... bien... bien... merci... Oh! Un instant s'il vous plait.
Four fourteen.
Voulez vous essayer la chambre quatre cents quatorze?...Merci.
I can't believe it.
She didn't come back?
At least nobody's seen her. What on earth...
Look -- you get back to the hotel right away -- and see if you can find out what's going on.
It's so unlike my wife...
I'll finish up with the police and join you as soon as I can.
Right. But don't worry. Probably some stupid misunderstanding. If I find out anything before you get back, I'll ring you here.
Just don't waste any time!
Who was it, Ben?
It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He heard we were being held by the Police and thought there was some way he could help us.
That was nice of him.
I told him if we weren't back there in fifteen minutes to call the American Consulate in Casablanca.
But, Monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place, that you wished to consult with your consul!
Let's go, Jo.
There is just one small formality. I must request you to sign a statement of the facts.
If it doesn't take too long.
But a moment. I will send for a typist.
Ben...
Let me see the message.
I don't -- I don't think you should.
I'm your wife, Ben -- not the police inspector. Let's see it.
Why didn't you give this to the police?
Because I didn't want to.
But Ben, a man's life --
...is at stake, I know, But I'm not sure of what's the right thing to do.
I thought we ought to go back to the hotel, pack our clothes, take Hank, and get out of this country as quickly as we can.
Maybe.
Hank, seeing a man killed in front of him. What a shook it must be to his mind.
I know.
Why don't you just give that note to the American Consulate -- Why get any more involved?
Jo...about Hank...
What about him?
Well...he...he's the kind of a kid who can take of himself.
You get the key. I'll take care of the driver.
Okay.
Uh...pardon me.
Yes, m'sieu?
Do you know Mrs. Drayton?
The English lady?
Did you see her come back from the market place anytime in the past hour or so?
No, m'sieu.
Wait a minute. You don't understand... she had a small boy with her. Mine.
No, m'sieu.
How about Mister Drayton?
Oui, m'sieu. M'sieu Drayton check out.
He what?
Checked out.
He couldn't have.
Oui, m'sieu. He did.
No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman with horn-rimmed glasses.
Oui, m'sieu. Checked out.
Ben, What's holding you up?
Frankly, I'm exhausted. Don't you feel well?
I'll call Mrs. Drayton and tell her we're back. She can bring Hank up here, or I'll go get his.
Jo, hold the call for a minute.
Why?
Because I asked you to.
Ben...we're about to have our monthly fight.
I hope we don't.
Then stop playing Rasputin. I only said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.
Wait 'til I come back.
Something to relax you.
I'm so relaxed I'm tired. You take them.
Jo, they're for you. I'm the doctor.
Ben...
You know how you get when things happen -- tense and upset. Now do me a favor.
Six months ago you told me I took too many pills!
Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder. You've been excited, fatigued -- talking a blue streak and going around in circles.
I have not.
Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine. You'll feel a lot better tomorrow if you take these today. But you don't think so. Okay, I'll make a deal with you.
I'm listening.
There's something about Louis Bernard, the police station, and this whole spy business that I haven't told you yet.
This is the price of curiosity.
What could it be?
There's one way to find out.
All right, Doctor McKenna. I am now relaxed and listening.
Why don't I call Mrs. Drayton first. You can tell me while she's bringing Hank up.
Just a minute. This whole thing strange right from the very beginning.
It was no accident that Louis Bernard helped us out on the bus, and struck up a conversation. You were right about him.
See.
Yes...yes, you were right about him. He was...was strange.
I know all that. Get to the surprise.
He got talking to us because he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple.
Nothing suspicious about us.
He was wrong. It was a different married couple.
And he was killed before he found them.
No. He found them. In the restaurant. Last night. That's why he was killed.
You'll be telling me next it was Mr. and Mrs. Drayton!
That's just who it was, Jo.
If that's a joke, I don't think it's a very funny one.
Think I'll lie down.
Listen to me. And listen carefully.
That phone call I received at the police station.
It wasn't from the concierge at the hotel. It was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if I told anybody one word of what. Louis Bernard whispered to me in the market place that something...something might happen to...to, to Hank.
Hank? Why H... ?
They've taken him away.
Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel. She is downstairs!
Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never came back here! And Hank didn't either!
Well let's start looking for him. Mr. Drayton...Mr. Drayton should...
Jo, Mr. Drayton, checked out of the hotel thirty or forty minutes ago!
Ben!! I could kill you! Sedative!
All this time you, knew Hank was gone, and you wouldn't tell me.
I wasn't sure, until now.
He's my child more than yours! I had him.
Let go of me! I'll never never never forget this! We've got to find Hank! We've got to find him.
You think you're the only one strong enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I hate you, with my whole heart. Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank! Get him, Ben. Please. You damn miserable human...how could anybody...do...
He has forced her down on the bed, pinioning her arms, even though her legs still struggle somewhat. She is having a hard time seeing, or talking. Her head waves back and forth. It's hard work for Ben to hold her.
I...never wanted to...come here in...first...Place...oh Hank, Hank darling...if I ever...wake...I'll kill...you...you...
Darling, if somebody did this to me, I'd say just what you said.
Ben quickly puts the final items of the boy's clothes on top of the rest in the suitcase and closes it. He picks up the suitcase and carries it into the larger room, the CAMERA PANNING him.
As Ben enters the main room, he glances at his wife.
Jo's eyes are beginning to open and close, and she shakes her head a little, as she tries to recover from the sedative he gave her.
Ben puts down Hank's suitcase, and crosses to their own luggage, the CAMERA PANNING him in such a way as to keep Jo in the background. He opens the suitcases, and begins taking clothes out of the dresser drawers to pack them.
Jo opens her eyes and looks about her. She tries to straighten up her hair a little. She takes in the room, and then as though a sudden thought strikes her, she looks toward the open door of her missing son's bedroom.
Jo stares at the empty room for a moment longer, then turns sharply back toward her husband.
From her viewpoint we see the back view of Ben is he continues packing. Ben half-glances over his shoulder now aware that she is fully awake.
There's still no news of him, Jo.
She stares at him apathetically.
We now see Ben's face as he packs his suitcases. Beyond him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his direction. He continues to talk, although he finds it difficult to be matter-of-fact, moving back and forth from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.
Both the Draytons are definitely gone. The hotel register says they come from London. Drayton told the concierge he was a college professor. The only thing to do now is to get out of Marrakesh.
As individuals we're helpless here. And because of that phone call, we can't bring the police in on it. I even thought of taking that chance.
But connect Hank's disappearance to Louis Bernard's murder. And the first thing they'd do would be to make me tell them Louis Bernard's message. That...that could be, Hank's...well, it wouldn't help him.
We're going to London.
I found out. The Draytons had a private plane -- that's how they took Hank back. It could lend anywhere -- no question of a passport or anything.
So we're going to London to find him.
A Man...a statesman...is to be killed... assassinated ... in London...soon...very soon...tell them...in London...to try Ambrose Chappell... We're going to try this Ambrose Chappell and if he has anything at all to do with this, I'm going to offer him every cent I've got to got Hank back. This Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope. Understand, Jo?
We've only got a few hours, Jo! We have to got up and start moving.
I've paid the bill, and there's a car waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack, we're leaving.
Oh Ben, Ben, Ben...where is he? Where is he?
How could they remember me so well, Ben? It's been four years since I played London.
I guess you're the kind of girl they don't forget.
But how did they know...who could have told them...Ben, you didn't...?
All I did was wire Val and Helen Parnell to get us rooms --
But I didn't count on this --
Yes? What is it?
Whatever you say.
How do you do?
Now what do you people want with us?
Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat with you, inside.
Who is Mr. Buchanan?
Special Branch, Scotland Yard.
This is Mr. Buchanan -- Doctor and Mrs. McKenna.
How do you do?
Thank you, Woburn.
Do sit down, won't you?
Why does Scotland Yard want to talk with us?
Let me say at once, we're shocked... that you son was taken from you in Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.
Do you know where he is?
What about Hank? What have you heard?

I only wish I could give you some cheerful news.
We might find him. Quite soon, indeed, if we work together...Louis Bernard was sent to Marrakesh by the French at our request to check up on an assassination plot -- here, in London. A good agent keeps on staking his life. He doesn't always win.
Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust. He relied on you, to come to us.
Those people kidnapped your boy -- in order to keep your mouth shut. That's right, isn't it?
I think they took him for money.
Then why didn't you go straight to your Consulate in Casablanca? Why did you come to London?
Jo seems about to volunteer some information.
Mr. Buchanan --
Ben looks sharply at her.
Jo...
Buchanan seem only casually obvious of the exchange. But he has noted it In his mind.
You're convinced that these people brought your son to London. You're convinced you can find him -- off your own bat. You can't. It's impossible. But with the help we can give you, there's a chance. A really good chance.
Before Ben can stop her, Jo bursts in hotly.
They told us not to say anything!
Buchanan turns to her and speaks gently, but with force.
Anything you tell me will be in the most absolute confidence.
That might be true, but --
Your son is the trump card these people hold. He's perfectly safe -- for the moment.
And when they've done what they're going to do, they'll let him go. So all we have to do is wait.
No, Mrs. McKenna. If they consider the boy a nuisance, afterwards -- I'm afraid --
Now, don't try to frighten us, Mr. Buchanan.
It's exactly what I'm trying to do -- frighten you. I'm trying to prevent a man being murdered here, in London.
If you don't tell me all you know, you become an accessory before the fact of murder. In English law, you become just short of murderers yourselves.
Jo, a creature of emotion, is bewildered and upset and tired of fighting Buchanan. She is ready to give in. She looks to Ben.
Ben, what can we do by ourselves? We need --
You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr. Buchanan. Louis Bernard talked to me, not my wife.
Then you tell me.
Bernard spoke in French, and I don't understand a word of the language.
And what did you write down on a piece of paper?
Ben -- maybe they could find those people, and Hank, before --
Maybe. Maybe isn't good enough for me, and it shouldn't be good enough for you.
You act as if you're the only one who's concerned about Hank.
Now Jo, I didn't mean it that way. We made up our minds what we were going to do -- now let's try to stick to it.
We'd like to cooperate with you, Mr. Buchanan -- but -- but we just can't.
I have a son of my own. I don't know what I'd do...
Well, maybe if we --
A phone call for you, Mrs. McKenna.
Put the call through here, please.
Mrs. McKenna.
In the outer office Woburn quickly hands Buchanan the phone, who puts it to his ear.
Jo puts the phone to her ear. She speaks hesitantly.
Hallo.
Mrs. McKenna?
Yes.
This is Mrs. Drayton. You remember me?
Mrs...Drayton?
Ben reacts with surprise, and gives a stop or two forward. He is tense.
Jo recovers herself.
Where's Hank? Where have you got him?
He's here. With me. You mustn't worry about him, really you mustn't.
Jo shows some relief, but she's still deeply concerned.
Where is he? Where have you got him?
I expect you'd like to speak to him, wouldn't you?
Yes. Please, please!
Hello. Hello, Hank?
Just a minute.
Mummy? Mummy is that you?
Oh, Hank, Hank darling, are you really all right?
I'm a little scared, mummy. But I'm all right -- I guess. I miss you mummy, I miss you so much.
Hank. This is daddy.
Is mummy crying?
Where are you, Hank? Where are you?
I didn't mean to make her cry, daddy, but I'm scared, and I want to see her.
Hank, where are you? For Heaven's sake, where are you?!!
Welbeck eight --
He was scared.
It was a London telephone exchange.
Woburn comes in the office, goes to Buchanan.
Public call box -- West One.
Buchanan looks at the pair, and sighs in a manner that suggests he recognizes defeat, when he sees it.
Do I have to say any more?
You may change your minds. If you do, this number will reach me.
In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in the main room, as the McKennas look about.
It's fine. Just fine.
Oh yes. Thank you.
It's from the Panell's. "Welcome home, Jo. Look forward to seeing your family. Especially the little--"
Cindy and Jan. You don't know Cindy and Jan.
Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the notebook to Jo.
You'd better keep your book.
What are you looking for?
The only clue we have which might lead us to Hank. The place and identity of Mr. Ambrose Chappell.
Ben pauses, notes the place on the Page, and reaches for some notepaper and a pen from the desk.
There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose Chappell.
Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett Street. Camden Town. Telephone - Gulliver 6198.
Don't you want me to call him?
I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do the wrong thing.
I'll try not to be too wrong.
What are you going to say?
I'll offer to keep my mouth shut and give him all the money we have -- for Hank. Operator. Get me ... Gulliver 6198. Thank you.
I go.
Jo! You look wonderful!
When we got your wire I couldn't believe it. What were you doing down in Morocco?
Sightseeing.
Two minutes later Helen was on the phone to me. And I had to call Jan.
You're the perfect answer to what London needs, Jo. This week's the dullest thing since my first show.
Hello, Val. Jo and I want to thank all of you for the lovely flowers. But you shouldn't have. We might not be here long!
Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell? Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I will...I
Oh hello, Mr. Conway. Didn't know you were there.
It's McKenna...Doctor McKenna. Welcome to London Town, doctor.
Oh, I am sorry. I knew you were married, but a doctor. How clever! Especially in such a psychosomatic business. Why --
Will you be quiet!
Cindy!
You don't know what psychosomatic means.
I do too! It means when your mind gets sick of your body it does something to it --
The doctor's trying to talk on the phone.
It's only business. It's nothing.
Business is everything. Shhh.
Hello? Mr. Ambrose Chappell? I said is this Ambrose Chappell? ...Well this Mr. McKenna. Uh,...Doctor Benjamin McKenna.
I don't think we need to be quiet. Would you like some drinks?
Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at your address for a while? Uh huh, it's just some business. Nothing big. Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop around.
See. We could have talked.
That's what I told you.
I'd like everyone to meet my husband.
I've heard so much about you, Doctor, it's nice to see you in person.
You look just like, those pictures Jo had in her dressing room four years ago. Haven't changed a bit.
Why should he? He's a doctor. Probably gets free hormones.
And this one is Jan Peterson who sing almost as well as I do, but can handle those legs like Nijinsky.
I can believe it. How do you do, Jan.
When Nijinsky got off the stage he was through with his footwork. That's just when mine begins.
And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful expatriate I've ever known.
Haven't you been home recently?
How can I go back to Harrisburg? They know me there as Elva MacDuff Cindy. It doesn't fit any more.
Where's your boy? I'd like to see which one you he looks like.
He -- he's staying with some other people -- so we can have a little time to ourselves.
What's his name?
Hank. Henry, really.
I hope he has your looks, and the doctor's brains.
Thank you again for the beautiful flowers.
I'm taking orders for drinks.
Okay. But dinner tonight's on me.
Room service, please.
A welcome home for Jo. And I wish I could persuade her to stay a month.
Oh, Val -- I wish I could, but...
Will you order the stuff?
I'll be back in a little while.
Aren't you going to wait for a drink, doctor.
Thank you, but I'll catch up when I get back.
Ben!
Maybe he's tired. Maybe he'd like to sleep, or something. Maybe he has ulcers and can't eat.
Ben, please ...
It has to be done, Jo.
I Want to go with you.
Jan, how somebody so graceful can have such an awkward sense of diplomacy, I'll never know.
You can't. I won't disappear. Promise.
Ben, for the last time, please let me go.
Two people are much easier to follow than one. We don't want Buchanan's men on our tracks. Or the other people, either. I'm going out by the service entrance --
He resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING HIM. The echo starts again. He slows up again and stops -- but this time the echo continues. He becomes tense, looks around in alarm.
Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING him. He stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo -- but the echo comes on after him. Slightly scared, he now resumes his walk with a more hurried pace. The echo gets louder. He glances quickly over his shoulder again.
Ben continues walking, and after a bit cautiously glances behind him.
The same man is following behind.
Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks up trying to locate the right house number as he walks. The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty- looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that he would like to make his destination before the man following catches up with him. Then he changes his mind. He deliberately slows up.
Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the man approaching behind him, listening with the back of his head, and with his whole body. The man walking behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him.
Ben watches the man go on ahead of him at a faster pace. Suddenly the man turns a sharp right into doorway, and is gone. Ben glances at the paper in his hand. He stops and looks up in astonishment.
The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned. Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."
Ben hesitates briefly in thought, puts the piece of paper into his pocket, then makes up his mind and goes through the doorway.
I...I'd like to speak to Mr. Ambrose Chappell, please.
Ben follows the workman into the shop. It is cluttered with stuffed animals of every size and shape imaginable. Lions, tigers, elephant heads, swordfish, crocodiles -- everything. Ben stares around at what he sees. A number of workmen are busy mounting, stuffing, and preparing animals for display. The workmen who let him in calls to someone.
A man, about eighty years old, turns from inspecting a piece of work, and comes forward to Ben. He is a thin, gracious, gentle sort of creature.
Well you see, I uh...
Oh, of course, McKenna. Doctor Benjamin McKenna, I called you.
You are Ambrose Chappell?
You do?
From behind a doorway on the far side a man emerge s in response to the call. He is somewhat younger than the first Ambrose Chappell, but not by much. He is the fifty-year-old gentleman who had been apparently following Ben on the street. The CAMERA PANS him over following to his father, and Ben.
I'm Doctor Mckenna. Does the name mean anything to you?
Chappell Jr. nods his head, but waits with a deadpan expression for Ben to continue. After a pause, Ben does.
You have no idea why I came here?
I was given your name by someone I happened to meet in Marrakesh.
I suppose you've heard of him. Louis Bernard. A Frenchman.
The workmen half-listening, return to their work on the various animals. They are a bit self-conscious at being observed eavesdropping.
Ben turns back to Chappell Jr. He moves in a little closer, and drops his voice somewhat. Chappell Jr. watches him warily.
Let's stop fencing with words, huh? Bernard told me to come here, just before he died.
You know it as well as I do. Now I came to make a business proposition. And I don't see how you can turn it down.
You want to talk here?
Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered one word of what Bernard told to before he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm not interested in political intrigue, and I don't care who it is you're going to kill here in London. All I want is that boy, and I'll get on the first plane for America.
Now that isn't all. If money will do anything...
You told him to call the police. Now don't try to bluff me like that!
Chappell Jr. struggles to get loose from Ben's grasp.
You don't know Louis Bernard?
And you don't have any idea what went on in Marrakesh yesterday, or where my boy is?
Now just a minute. Take it easy. I obviously got the wrong place. Now stay away from me.
Shooting toward the doorway. The confusion gives him a free moment. He makes the door, twists it open, and dashes out into the yard. Suddenly he turns back and dashes in again. The man retreat in fear. Ben picks up his fallen hat and dashes out again.
The five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her disinterest.
...and back at our flat, after the first night, Chris had the nerve to suggest that the sketch where Bud Flanagan comes in dressed up as the Countess was unconvincing ... that no matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan was, even if he were dressed by Hartnell, nobody would believe he was an aristocrat. So I said, 'Look Chris, why don't you cut William Hickey's column out of the paper?! --
Jo. Jo.
Huh?
What's become of that unpredictable husband of yours? He's been gone over an hour.
Who was it he went to see? Some man named... ...what was it...Church?
No. No...you mean Chappell!
It's not a man, it's a place! Ambrose Chapel! Ambrose Chapel! It has to be!
The others watch Jo, puzzled at her strange performance. No one dares speak until she finds out what it means.
With some excitement, Jo addresses Val Parnell.
Do they list chapels in the London Telephone Directory?
Let's a take a look.

Here it is, Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose Street, West Two.
I'm very sorry.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 97.
But have another drink -- and please explain to Ben when he comes in.
There's something weird going on around here that I can't follow.
Let's see if we can figure this out. First of all there was a man named to uh...
Ambrose Chapel.
And Ben rushed off to see him.
Then Jo said it wasn't a man, but a place and she dashed off.
Don't mention it again or I might dash off.
What a temptation.
Can you fathom it, Val?
It must be a now American gag. I'll ask Danny about it.
Too tired to say anything at first, Ben drops into the first chair he comes to. Then he looks up.
Where's Jo?
She's just gone off to Ambrose Chapel.
But -- but, that's where I've been...

It isn't your Ambrose Chapel!
It isn't a he! It's an it! A building.
She's just gone there.
Ben studies the group trying to appraise in his mind what they have said.
Where is it! What's the address?
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.
Doctor! Doctor! It's Jo! Come back -- it's Jo.
He goes immediately to the phone. Jan hands Ben the receiver.
Jo?
Ben -- Ben, darling...what happened -- did you find anything?
No -- I drew a complete blank.
Then it must be the chapel - and I've found it, Ben. It's just a short way from here. It was a crazy thing to do --
I have the address, Jo. Now stay there until I get there...and don't do anything!
I'll meet you outside.
Ben hangs up the phone and starts for the door. He looks back at the group as he pauses in doorway.
Will you stick around? We'll be back as soon as we can. I don't know how to thank you.
Jo stands watching something across the street.
The CAMERA THEN PANS her across the empty chapel to a side door. She goes through it.
She comes up a flight of stairs, the CAMERA MOVING with her. She stops at a door on the first landing, takes a key out of her pocket, and unlocks the door. She enters.
Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind her and stands with her back to it, watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless, young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious satisfaction jumps three of her men.
Three men! You don't know much about checkers, do you?
It's time you went to bed, dear. You'll get tired out.
Can I finish? I'm winning?
Yes, you finish. Edna, see that he gets some milk and biscuits.
You'll go to sleep, Hank, won't you?
I guess so.
Look it doesn't hurt to be kind. Yell out when you want me to open the door.
I wish it was tomorrow.
That's not a very orthodox sentiment.
Two excellent tickets for the concert at the Albert Hall -- with my compliments.
Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed.
Now for the most important part.
What is it?
A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight.
What about it?
Music is less in your line than marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully.
Let me do it for you again. Now listen for the cymbal crash.
You see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer would have appreciated that. No one will know.
None except one you mean.
Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend. Any questions musical or otherwise?
No.
There's's one comforting thought. It happens early in the evening. I hope I won't upset you if I say there's time for one shot only. If you need another, the risk is yours.
I do not take risks.
That's a comfort -- traipsing all the way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I should like you to do me credit.
Your distinguished target's on the way there now. A car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. You will pick up a Miss Benson on your way. She will be your companion in the box. She's there to lend an air of respectability...if that's possible.
You will have the money when I return?
I think you can trust me.
What is your English proverb -- a wolf in Sheep's clothing?
I think you had better be going. It is impolite to be late for a concert. It would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over.
See him downstairs, my dear. I'm sorry you must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable front.
Ben comes up to her. She grips his hands.
There it is.
You may have just hit it right on the nose. You can't be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let's go.
Ben, should we get some help from the police?
No, honey, please, no -- let's take a crack at this alone.
Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately. Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.
This looks like mother wild goose chase.
Let's wait and look around...
Look who's coming down the aisle.
Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben immediately eases his way along behind a column which hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall woman in front of her, but she is not entirely successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to them.
As the astonished Mrs. Drayton turns to go back down the aisle with her plate of coins and bills, we now see the surpliced Mr. Drayton ascending the pulpit. He looks down to his wife.
The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his sermon.
Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.
Brothers and Sisters The subject of my address this evening is adversity. The average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control.
Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon. Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered.
That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police.
What if he asks me...
Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place.
Ben, I don't want to leave you.
I don't know how else to do it, honey.
Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 109.
But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you.
Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart. There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly.
When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton goes off through a side door by the altar, while the organist makes her way down the aisle through the congregation to stand by the door.
The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel, Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets him with bland amiability.
Well this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.
Where's my boy, Drayton?
He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking.
Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat of his robes.
What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy.
And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air.
Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.
All right -- you'll see your boy in good time.
One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves. Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and suddenly dashes for the steps.
Hank! Hank McKenna! Hank! Where are you? Hank! Hank!
Daddy! Daddy, I'm here! Dad -
Jo speaks into the phone with great urgency.
...And Ben is in there now, watching the both of them!
He sent me out to call you -- so we could do something before they get away.
I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel?
I don't know, I don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them.
I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.
Jo interrupts him, impatient with his caution.
Mr. Woburn, there isn't any time! My husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. Can't I talk with Mr. Buchanan? He said when we needed him, to call.
I'm awfully sorry, but I simply can't get hold of him just now. He's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair -- at the Albert Hall.
Jo is tired of his talk. She wants action.
Well call him there, please! Call him!
He's on his way. I don't know quite --
Then can't you do anything -- right away -- before we lose the Draytons?
I assure you, I'll do all I cant as soon as I can.
Jo is at the frantic point.
We don't have days to do this. It's a matter of minutes. Can't you send the police. Or do I have to go to the Albert Hall myself.
That won't be necessary. I'll see that the chapel is put under immediate observation. By the time you get back a police car should be there. Please return to your husband, tell him to come straight out of the chapel, and let the police take over.
Woburn, Special Branch, hold on. I must ring off now, Mrs. McKenna. Please believe me, I'll have everything laid on.
With a feeling of frustration, Jo hangs up the phone as Woburn clicks off on the other end. She exits to the phone booth.
The door locked. She tries it again. It does not give. She bangs her on the door. No one answers. Jo's face is puzzled and a frightened.
The CAMERA PANS Jo to the right side of the Chapel. There is no sign of life down the whole side of it.
Jo returns to the front door, examines it, tries it again. Now there is definite panic in her face. There Is the sudden sound of a car pulling up quickly to the curb. She turns.
Jo comes up to the three men. One of them, in charge, does the talking.
There's nobody there!
Are you Mrs. McKenna?
Yes, but something's wrong. A few minutes ago the place was full of people, and now there's nobody!
Our orders are to keep it under observation until a Scotland Yard car arrives.
My husband's in there. There must have been thirty or forty people... and now...
When was this?
It couldn't...it couldn't have been more than five minutes ago!
Let's take a look.
I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.
I tried that. It's looked, Let's force it open.
I'm sorry, madam, we can't break in. Requires a search warrant. It's the law, you see.
Couldn't you get one?
It all takes time. We'll have a look round, shall we? Matthews, you take the other end.
Patterson and Jo peer in the windows. They apparently see nothing.
Another policeman is checking the windows on the other side. Nothing.
The third policeman is checking the alleyway in back of the Chapel. He sees no sign of anything suspicious. Patterson and Jo come around the back and try the back door.
The back door is firmly locked.
Are you quite certain the place was full of people -- only a few minutes ago?
Of course I'm certain. I was there myself, sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.
It's much too complicated to explain.
We'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the Yard.
The chapel is deserted inside. In the dim light we can see a form stretched out on the floor. It is Ben. He begins to stir a little as if just beginning to come to after being knocked unconscious.
The policemen are grouped around the patrol car, as Patterson, the sergeant, talks over a radio telephone.
So far as we can make out, sir, there's no sign of life. I see, very good, Sir.
Walden, you'll stay here, till the car arrives from the Yard.
That's all, Matthews.
You're not leaving?
Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.
Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our beat. Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank?
All right. Let's go.
Inside the chapel we can see the cause of the spasmodic bell ringing. Ben is using the rope to climb out of the chapel. He succeeds in reaching high window. He holds on to the window, and looks down.
Ben decides to swing to the opposite window which will be away from the street. He swings, grabs, and with some difficulty manages a foothold. He finally climbs out through the window.
Ben moves cautiously out onto the roof of the chapel. Beyond and below him we can see people on the street. He manages to lay low and crawl over the roof, the CAMERA PANNING him. We can now see beyond and below the patrolman returning with two regular uniformed policemen. They are crossing toward the chapel looking up, as we:
Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people, perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time because they had no money, take their turns at the window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the queue.
I would like to see the manager, please.
Please, I must speak to one of them. Which are they?
Jo tries to push her way through towards him. The people around her resent her efforts. Behind Jo are two girls in their early twenties. Both are Chelsea types.
In the foreground are passing people hurrying towards their seats. There, taking a step forward and staring in Jo's direction, is Rien, the Assassin. His face shows considerable alarm at what he sees.
Rien, with a quick thought, hurries over to her.
The two are in SEMI-CLOSEUP. He says to her quietly:
You have a very nice little boy, madame.
Where Is he? Where is he?
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we now see that the crowd in the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary in his box.
Jo stares toward the opening into the hall. She seems drawn to go in. She crosses and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her to the first entrance to the outer corridor.
If you don't mind, I'm just looking for someone.
Jo stares at the vast hall in front of her.
From her viewpoint she sees the complete hall, the orchestra and choir assembled, and a round of applause is heard as the conductor is seen threading his way toward the instruments and mounts the podium.
Jo steals a glance toward the box which first catches her eye.
From her viewpoint she sees the flag-draped box of the foreign visitor. It is full of his entourage and seat slightly to the left of him in the second row 'Buchanan' is sitting. Nearer to her and in front of 'Buchanan' on one side of the dignitary is a be-medalled, blue- sashed individual who might be an Ambassador.
Jo turns her head away and looks at the other side.
The CAMERA roves among the boxes. Suddenly it stops on one as the Assassin takes his seat with his woman escort like any ordinary couple. They are quite casual in their behavior.
Jo becomes transfixed. A sudden silence returns her attention to the orchestra.
From her viewpoint we see the full orchestra, the conductor with raised baton.
The Women's choir raise their sheets of music in unison.
A nearer view of the orchestra.
A whole sweep of the orchestra with the choir predominant.
A skimming shot over the top of the orchestra with the strings in the foreground predominant. The SOUND of these instruments seems to dominate the other music due to their proximity to the CAMERA.
The cellos -- again their sound dominates the scene.
The woodwinds -- the same sound effect.
Now the brass. Their notes drown out the rest of the orchestra.
Now the double brass. As each of these shots follow in succession, we get more intimate with each group of instruments and finally:
To the timpani where we just hear the kettle drums booming away.
At last one individual, who is seated with legs crossed and arms folded, on a chair, and beside him on another chair, the cymbals.
The inert cymbals resting on their chair.
Rien in his box is glancing toward the orchestra. He looks down beside him and slowly picks something up from a chair.
Jo stares up and catches her breath.
From her viewpoint we see Rien is raising a pair of small black leather opera glasses which he puts to his eyes and studies his target.
Jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitary's box. He is turning to the man beside him, whom we shall later know as the Ambassador, and indicates with gestures how much he is enjoying the concert. He looks back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and comments to 'Buchanan'. Then, turning forward, he settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music.
Ben look the other way and upstairs.
From his viewpoint the other direction -- just emptiness.
The CAMERA PANS Ben as he hurries forward. He touches Jo lightly on the shoulder. She turns, startled, and manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him. We do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime we see that Jo is telling Ben all about the impending shooting. Ben argues with her. He indicates he will tell Buchanan. She frantically restrains him but he shakes her off and dashes away.
We see Ben ascending the stairs originally taken by the dignitary and his group.
Ben comes into the corridor and looks about him. Beyond him we see a group of men obviously detectives, and ahead of them a police constable. We see Ben hurry in his direction.
Ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him when he is stopped. We again do not hear the dialogue, but the pantomime shows that Ben is trying to get to Buchanan. The constable doesn't quite know what to make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who is standing in a small group a little way off. From his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's direction.
Jo, looking over her shoulder and then up to the box of the dignitary. She turns desperately towards the direction of the Assassin's box.
Another view of the orchestra, but the duration of it on the screen is much quicker.
A flash of the Violins.
A flash of the cellos.
A quick flash of the brass.
A timpani section.
The cymbals still laying on the chair.
The Inspector is turning to Ben, the Constable on one side. Again in pantomime the Inspector questioning the impatient Ben. He leaves Ben and goes over to the men standing outside the door to the box. Ben half- turns away with exasperation toward the CAMERA.
The singers.
The timpani.
We see a different angle the cymbals filling the screen. CAMERA PULLS BACK quickly and the man who is to wield them unfolds his arms and uncrosses his legs. He leans forward to glance at his score.
Ben is still waiting for the Inspector to discuss matters with the plainclothesman. He turns and hurries away, the CAMERA PANNING him.
Jo is almost weeping with the effect of the singing and the emotional stress she is going through.
In the orchestra, the cymbal player now places one hand on the cymbals on the chair.
In the box the Assassin places his hand for the first time inside his coat towards his holster. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the woman sitting with him, seeing this gesture, rising and backing away into the dark recesses of the box.
Ben is now quickly listening into the section behind the boxes, one of which is occupied by the Assassin.
Ben looks along the corridor.
From his viewpoint we see rows of boxes.
Ben is a little nonplussed. He approaches one.
Back in the orchestra the conductor is wielding his baton vigorously. He swings over a sheet of music.
The choir turns over their music.
The cymbal player turns over his music. He looks at the music in front of him and for the first time picks up the cymbals.
A closer view of Ben shows him trying another door cautiously and surreptitiously. He looks in and then softly closes the door. He moves further along and tries another door with the same cautious movement.
The Assassin now has his gun out in the darkness of the rear of the box.
The cymbal player watching his music, his cymbals held.
From his viewpoint with the cymbals tipping the bottom of the screen, we see all his music. It is blank. The CAMERA SWIFTLY MOVES IN to the bottom of the right- hand page showing the one note he is to strike.
Jo becoming more anxious and desperate. She looks up towards the Assassin's box with horror as she sees:
The Assassin's figure moving forward and the tip of the gun for the first time.
The conductor looks up towards the cymbal player.
The player raises the cymbals.
A close view of the poised gun in the Assassin's box.
The dignitary's pleased and smiling face.
The gun poised. It fills the screen.
The cymbals are held in the foreground and through them we can see the orchestra and the conductor beyond. The conductor looks up from his score and points deliberately to the cymbal player.
The cymbals clash together.
Jo leaping forward with a scream.
The dignitary is clutching his arm and slumping forward. We gain an impression of those around leaping to their feet.
The people around Jo, startled as they rise in their seats and turn back to her.
Ben dashes to a final door and swinging it open finds himself face-to-face with the Assassin. The latter's hand goes for his holster. He pulls out his gun. Ben lunges forward with a blow.
The soprano singers in the middle of their note quickly change it to a unified scream.
The music trails off as the orchestra rises to its feet at the startling occurrence.
The hall is in an uproar.
The people around the dignitary in his box are backing up to give him air. Someone is examining his wound. He see by his movements and a shake of his head that he is not dead.
Jo is still standing looking up.
From her viewpoint she sees Ben leaning over the box in horror looking down at the dead Assassin below. The door opens and the uniformed and plainclothes police dash into The box.
We see Ben hurrying down the stairs. Jo rushes into the lobby and, seeing Ben, dashes towards him.
We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the conversation. Ben is just saying:
Then he didn't kill him?
From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister, obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate, being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.
I'll report to you fully at the Embassy, Your Excellency. In the meantime...
The manager is leading Ben and Jo across to the foot of the stairs. They are reluctant but he insists. As the CAMERA PANS them over they meet the group at the bottom at the stairs. The manager calls out to Mr. Woburn and indicates Ben and Jo.
Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady who --
My dear lady, I shall be for ever in your debt.
And this is her husband --
A pleasure, my dear sir... I trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude.
It wasn't -- it wasn't --
Oh but it was, my dear lady.
Ben and Jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do or where to go next. Woburn standing with Ben and Jo. They look up and see Buchanan.
I think Mr. Buchanan would like to talk to you.
From their viewpoint a grim 'Buchanan' is standing at the top of the stairs.
When they reach him they have only one thought in their minds to ask him.
Where's our boy? Where's Hank?
We can talk if you'll come in here.
So you both know the time and place all along.
Don't be a fool.
An odd coincidence -- both of you turning up here.
Too bad you didn't contact your assistant. He sent us both here.
I beg your pardon.
You see, we finally needed that help you offered. We still need it.
Yes, Mr. Buchanan. We still need it.
I'll see her later.
Please tell me everything, now. Everything. There's still plenty of room for hope, Mrs. McKenna...
Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman won't talk, she won't talk and that's that, I suppose. All right.
Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman.
Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?
His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless.
Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.
I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh...
I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no doubt?
I don't know what to say ...
No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh...Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped?
How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue?
And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy?
I didn't think...I only thought...
How are you going to get the child out of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car --
With plain-clothes detectives planted right round this building? You English intellectuals will be the death of us all.
I'll think of some method. Just give me time....
Time!
I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.
Oh, no!
Right, I'll see to it..
Come in.
...recognized him, and he recognized me. So he jumped for it. And that is all.
Trying to liquidate one of their own big-shots. I wish they'd stick to their usual custom, and do it in their own country...
Hello. Hold on.
Buchanan speaking.
Right. Bye.
The Draytons are at the Embassy.
How do you know?
We have ways of finding out -- from the inside.
If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to be there too!
You're probably right. But we can do nothing.
Why can't you?
Every Embassy in a foreign country has extra-territorial rights.
What does that mean in common language?
As far as we're concerned, this Embassy stands on foreign soil.
Does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?
We could have the Foreign Office serve a writ on the Ambassador.
...You know, I'm not responsible for the complications of International Law...
...If only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there.
What's the telephone number of this Embassy.
What are you thinking about, Ben?
Grosvenor 0144.
I'm going to speak to the Minister himself.
May I speak to the Prime Minister, please?
Tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him. Its important.
What am I supposed to say, Ben? I don't know -- Ben, half looking at Woburn and Buchanan, gives her instructions.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 144.
In the Ambassador's study underneath the oil painting of himself, the Prime Minister is escorted to a telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument. Having been told who was on the other and of the line he is all smiles as he greets Jo.
My dear lady...This is a charming surprise...
Delighted, delighted, delighted. The Ambassador, too, will be delighted. Any friends of mine are friends of his. We will drink a little toast to your country and to mine. Peacefully we will co-exist...Yes?
He said -- all right.
They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of people listening to the music of a string quartet playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager. The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid a round of polite applause. There are people rising from their chairs and a general movement out into the hallway.
The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room people begin to notice them, first of all because they are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first row.
The Prime Minister recognizes them immediately, and comes forward quickly to meet them.
Good evening, good evening!
This is the charming lady who saved my life at the Concert!
Madame, you saved the life of the one man, who is irreplaceable in our Country.
They tell me you are the famous Jo Conway, Madame?
Yes. I'm Jo Conway.
Do you think perhaps Madame might be persuaded to sing?
I'm sure she would be glad to... wouldn't you dear?
Well, I don't know. It's been some time...
I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening!
All right. I'm very flattered.
Stanis would you put up some chairs quickly. Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight...Jo Conway...the famous Jo Conway...she has graciously consented to sing for us .. Darling would you see that the Prime Minister has a very good seat.
No...I'll just stand over here.
Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes are on Jo.
Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check where Ben is.
The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be more entertainment, move toward the main room.
A tries out the keys of the Piano.
People are finding their seats. There is coughing, shuffling of feet, and then a gradual hush.
Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng around the room, particularly toward the various exits.
Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song. We see the great tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting.
The hallway, showing people crowded at the door, listening.
The first landing on the flight of stairs above the hallway. No one is around. Jo's voice loses some of its volume.
A higher stairway landing.
A second floor corridor, deserted. Jo's voice fading.
A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the song floating up clearly, but much diminished.
In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled. Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to open it.
That's my Mother's voice! That's my Mother singing!
Hank -- are you sure? Are you really sure?
Hank turns around at the doorway, to look at Mrs. Drayton.
That's her! I know it!
Mrs Drayton's face, still awed by what she has heard.
What is she doing here?
Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton, listening and thinking about what he hears.
Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought coming into it. She looks down at Hank.
Hank? -- can you whistle that song?
He looks at her and nods abstractedly.
I guess so.
Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom to find Ben, and her eyes go up.
Watching her, Ben understands. He gives her the slightest sign of agreement.
Jo continues her song with almost excitement in her singing voice. The CAMERA passes around her as it follows Ben as he walks along the wall slowly.
Ben makes his way along the wall toward the far doorway, which leads to the grand staircase Everyone is so intent on listening to Jo, that his movement attracts no attention.
At the bottom of the service stairs in the back of the Embassy, Drayton is standing with two men who came with him in the car. One of them holds a short length of rope in his hand.
You two wait in the mail room. I'll bring him down.
Ben mounts two stairs leading up to the grand staircase. He looks about him cautiously.
At the service stairs, Drayton goes up two stairs and turns back to the men. He looks at his watch.
I won't be a minute.
Up in the room, Hank is bent in a chair, sobbing, Mrs. Drayton is kneeling by him, trying to reassure him. She stops suddenly as she hears footsteps in the distance. She rises to her feet, and as the footsteps grow and grow, she looks at the boy desperately, She goes to the door, hears the steps coming nearer and nearer. She looks across at the window.
The barred window.
She looks down at Hank almost protectively, as the footsteps get still nearer. She goes to Hank, kneels down again and clutches the boy to her as the footsteps stop outside the door. She looks at the door, with horror.
The door handle turns quietly, but firmly.
Mrs. Drayton lets out a piercing scream. Hank's head jerks up. The door is heard bursting open.
Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet, and the two of them come together. No clear words are spoken, Just muffled sounds of words as they hug each other. Then they release each other, and turn to look at Mrs. Drayton. She is standing, staring at the door with horror. Ben turns quickly to look.
Framed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches into his pocket and produces a small automatic.
For a moment the group stands there in silence. Then Ben speaks.
I don't think you want to start any shooting, Drayton -- with all those people downstairs, and police outside.
You've got to let the boy go!
Precisely my own notion, my dear.
I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help me out of here?
Don't ask me for help, you miserable....
Drayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly.
You wouldn't want your father to get hurt, would you?
Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode, but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning. Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face. He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it.
We'll go down the stairs together in a casual sort of way. Then we'll stroll along to the nearest taxi rank. I trust there won't be any emotional outbursts...
There won't be. Hank -- don't say or do anything.
Shall we go?
The trio, Hank in the center, slowly strolls down the corridor toward the main stairway. The sound of Jo Conway's voice can be heard from below.
SHOOTING FROM BELOW we see the big staircase empty for a moment, then the three appear at the top.
A closer view shows the terrified, tear-stained face of Hank, and the tense features of Ben. Drayton seems carefully alert. The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front of them as they descend. The music coming from the ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There is the sound of great applause. The three are about a dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs.
The applause having died out, the shot is heard loud, and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway. They rush for the stairway, and Drayton's body, led by the Ambassador and the Prime Minister.
As people crowd excitedly around the body, Ben is hurrying Hank away from the scene, the CAMERA PANS them.
Mrs. Drayton stops half-way down the stairway, and looks down in shook at the sight of her dead husband.
Inside the ballroom, which is emptying due to the rush of people to the corridor, Jo has risen from the piano and is almost afraid to go out and see what has happened. In a moment, Ben and the boy appear in the doorway. Hank rushes across the ballroom to his mother, who moves quickly when she sees him.
Mummy.
Hank.
I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val, but we had to go and pick up Hank.
Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm coming in.
Sure buddy. Let's do it. One of the college students put his arm around George while the other takes the picture.
Yeah bud. They take the picture.
Thanks. Tell your friends.
I like those lunestas. They really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover I get from the restorils.


I try not to take them too often. Just when I know I have to get up early.
Yeah, sure. She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in too.
Thanks, pal.
Is the turkey organic?
Yes, ma'am.
Well what does organic mean?
It means there's no additives or preservatives and it's hormone free.
Are there additives or preservatives in the food they feed the turkey?
I don't know ma'am.
I heard that because turkeys are fatty birds, mercury gets stuck in their fat. My daughter-in-law, she ate turkey and then she had a miscarriage.
I haven't heard about that. But I may not be informed enough to comment.
Well, you're not a doctor, so you shouldn't comment.
You are correct, I am not a doctor.
You should come see me do stand-up tonight at the Comedy and Magic Club.
I can't go through that again, man, that was painful.
That was five months ago. I've gotten a lot better.
They pay you yet?
Nah, not there. I just hang out and hope somebody doesn't show.
Wow, is there anyway for you to.be lower in show business? I don't know if you could even say you're in show business. Why don't you just fucking settle down and enjoy this gig? This is a sweet situation. The money's good, you've got health insurance.
Dude, I know you like it here but if I have to work here another year I would kill myself.
Really? In that case, when we bury you does it have to be in some kind of Jew cemetery? Next to Al Jolson or some shit?
Just come. I need the support.
No way. I'm funnier than you. And I'm not even that funny. I would go if I was paying to see me.
I'll pay your cover charge.
Okay, well you better be good, because I'm bringing a date.
Laughter's the ultimate lubricant.
I was thinking about doing something about how I'm not good looking and I'm not bad looking. I'm just good looking enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top. If that was the case.
Yeah, something about how the uglier you are, the better the personality you need. And the hotter you are, the stupider you can be.
I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world.
Maybe something like... you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world. And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world. The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people.
That could work.
Let me keep that one, because I thought of most of it.
That's not cool. I came up with the concept! What do you got? Let's work on what you have.
I've got nothing in the notebook. I got drunk last night. But I need material, because I just got spots at the Improv. Budd saw me and approved me. I'm in.
How could they make you a regular? I got turned down twice.
Sorry, man. They're only going to let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so I think you're fucked. Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them.
Hey, dudes. You see this check that I got from my TV show for 25,000 an episode? There was another one of these on the kitchen counter. Did you see it?
No we didn't see it. Just don't leave those things laying around.
I wouldn't leave it around if they didn't give me so many. They give it to me every episode.
Don't throw it in our face that you're on a shitty show.
I wouldn't, if it was a shitty show and not what Time magazine called "insightful and delightful."
I thought you were moving out.
I decided I like it here. Living with you guys keeps me grounded. I don't want to be the guy living in the house on the hill. Even though I could afford it. Hey, I saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs. I invited her in. She's here.
She's in our apartment? I've never even talked to her. I just gave her quarters at the washing machine.
You were right, she is pretty mousy and sexy. You gotta talk to her.
I need time. I have a three-month plan.
I'll give you ten days for your three-month plan, then I am going to fuck her. You can't just leave that laying around. Starting right now.
The thing about working on a sitcom is it's 22 weeks a year, so I can do stand-up the rest of the year.

But now people want to see me because they see me on a TV show, so I am kind of a draw. Have you seen the show?
I don't own a TV.
Well I think you can download it to an iPod. Ira walks in.
Hey Ira, this is Daisy.
how's it going?
Nice to meet you. I think I gave you quarters once. Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup. He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks horrified.
Don't worry, I'll just lick it off the counter. Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.

Hey man. George Simmons just got here, he wants to go up. You're bumped. We'll put you on after George.
Well how long is he going to do?
I don't know. Last night he did five minutes. Last week he did an hour. fie'il do what he wants to do.
Well what about the magician? He just loaded his pigeons. He said I have to get off in ten minutes.
I'll have him unload the pigeons. Just be ready. Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage.
That was good, right? Some of the new stuff worked.
I just got bumped by George Simmons.
Are you serious? Shit - I've got a spot at the Improv, I cant hang out, damn.

Ah life. What does it mean? sometimes life makes perfect sense. And then you `come'.
He's killing the crowd. Jesus, I can't follow this shit. After completely losing the crowd, and some minor confrontations with audience members, he exits the stage.
Life isn't all about laughs. Crazy shit happens. You've got to be nice to each other. You never know what's going to happen. Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.
Sorry I sucked it up out there. At least they are well rested for you. Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching, looking miserable.
I'm not good looking. I'm not bad looking. I'm just in the middle. And if I had a personality that was Jut good enough, it would put me over the edge. The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb, amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in Ira.
Sorry, man. I didn't mean to disturb you. I just can't open my door. There's no room.
Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out. George pulls the car back ten feet.
Hey man, you had some funny shit tonight.
Thanks!
Man, that audience hated you. They really did not like you. They liked your buddy, who looked exactly like you but was funnier. Man, that's going to haunt you. You're going to wake up in six months and think about this night.
Well, I'll probably bomb worse tomorrow and forget about this one.
I'm just fucking with you. You had some funny jokes in there. Good writing.
Well, obviously, I'm a... you know...I grew up on your shit, man. George just stares at him.
Alright, pal. Don't worry. Only two hundred people saw that tonight. I'll see you later. George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and starts screaming...
You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill you! Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.
Holy shit, you got seven hundred thousand hits in four days.
They put it on the main page at YouTube and it exploded. Which would be awesome if someone would pay me. The phone rings.
Hello?
Yeah. Who is this?
It's George.
Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going?
I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes.
Definitely. What kind of jokes? Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to include him in this job offer.
I don't know, about computers and shit. I could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little.
No problem. Where do you want me to send em?
What is your email? I will send you my fax and email and all that.
It's a...irasexiraÃÂ®gmail.com.
I almost just changed my mind. You got to change that.
Ok.
Today. Seriously. Ok. Later. Ira hangs up and turns to his friends.
That was George Simmons. He wants me to write jokes for him.
Holy shit. That is awesome. You are so lucky.
Are you gonna get to meet him?
I don't know, but he is gonna send me his email address.
We are gonna have his email address? I have to send him the link to my short.
Easy. Let me get in there a little more.
I got one, but you have to tell him its mine. The best thing about Leopard is it lets you watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. And you guys made that possible. We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George will ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re- typing, etc. Ira hesitates, then hits send.
There's some funny shit in here. Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit.
Thanks man. I just want to give you a lot of choices.
Too many choices. I don't like reading that much. I need like ten good jokes. I'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten. But thanks for doing it.
Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice. I spent the whole night pretending I was you.
So you cried yourself to sleep?
So you whacked off three times last night? Don't worry, I'll get you some money. Is five hundred good?
Yeah! That'll work.
I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig. You want to come check it out, see if your shit works?
Can we go outside and meet him?
No you can't. Because then we look like fans.
Maybe he's seen my show.
He doesn't watch your show. You're show is for eight-year-olds. It's a family show, he doesn't watch that shit.
I'll just go outside and pretend I'-,n washing my car. The Limo pulls up outside.
Holy shit. I feel like my little girl is going to the prom.
How you doing, you ready for this?
Yeah, this'll be fun.
I think I'm going to have you go on before me to warn them up.
You don't have to do that. What if I bomb?
Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be more excited to see me. They'll be so glad your not on stage any more. Then if you do well, they'll be ready for me. Either way, you're helpful.
I like this joke about watching porn and making porn all at the same time. That was a good one.
(turning white from
You want something to eat? I had them bring Chinese on the plane. Ira's eyes widen. He likes this way of life.
Uh...credits? I don't really have any credits. Maybe you could just say I've been working on Apples for so long, my first one weighed more than I did. Nobody laughs.
And just say he's a friend of mine, and I think he's funny.
What the fuck is that? You did three of the jokes that you wrote for me.
I panicked. They just wanted jokes about computers.
That's why I hired you, to write jokes about computers. Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.
But there's a lot more. The first three on this page. You didn't think they would work, but I think they will. You should just try them.
They better kill, I'm getting paid a hundred thousand dollars for this.
Are you serious? ANGLE ON DAVE on stage.
We'll be on the ground in a half hour. Want to go to a bar? Do something fun?
Sure. I like fun.
Here's a grand for the jokes and the gig. Even though you should be paying me after that. Ira's eyes widen.
Good job.
That's the most money I've ever made doing anything in comedy.
Then this is an exciting moment.
Well, I didn't make a hundred grand like you.
I feel nothing. I remember when a grand was the most exciting thing in the world. I'd go to Red Lobster and go nuts. Now it's just numbers in a bank account. Enjoy tonight. You made a thousand bucks.
Hey, let's all go back to my house.

Yeah, that sounds like a... nice idea.
Music is playing. Everybody is drinking. Mandy is doing some weird sort of sexy dance for George.
Oh there's a whole other wing that you wouldn't even know existed unless you went through this door.
You are very pretty.
I have a boyfriend. Nothing is going to happen.
I didn't say anything was going to happen. I just said you were pretty. How do you even know I wanted something to happen?
I hope she doesn't take a long time.
He can't believe he's having sex with you.
Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she left.
Really?
Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house.
Oh, well then I guess I better get going?
You don't have to go. I'm just saying that she left. I think she left her purse in the other wing. Come with me, let's go get it. Ira watches this, astonished.
Did Ira tell you I have a room with all the classic pinball machines and video games?
That sounds awesome.
Yeah, I got Galaga. Let's go check it out.
Hey don't go, I'll be back in a second.
That girl left. You want to talk to me while I try to go to sleep. Ira doesn't know what to make of this.
I guess so.
Did you have sex with both of those girls?
I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done. I figured you wouldn't mind.
That is crazy. That is super crazy.
It was great. It was crazy great.
How can that even happen? I guess I understand the first one, but why would the second one do it? You probably stink of the first girl.
Well, we took a steam shower together.
What?
she had never seen a steam shower before, I told her she should enjoy it.
She wouldn't fool around with me because she said she had a boyfriend.
She told me that too, but she says I was on her and her boyfriend's list of people she was allowed to screw. You'd be surprised how many women have me on that list.
I should get going.
Just talk to me before I fall asleep. I'm weird. I don't like being alone. You should crash in one of the rooms. You're too drunk to drive home. I won't try to fuck you, I just fucked two women and I'm kind of done.
I may have to whack it in your guest room.
Whack away, I don't give a shit.
Hey, you were funny tonight. I could see how you could get good.
Thanks. That was fun. It was rare that I get to play to more than twenty-five people. I've never played for a thousand.

it, s kind of easier, because even if two hundred like me, it sounds like a lot.
I do feel bad for you, because no matter how hard you try, you'll never be as funny as me.
Why would you say that?
Did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid?
No.
That's why. My dad always seemed annoyed with me. He'd always crack me on the head. You would not see it coming. I spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But he was an awesome guy. He was the coolest. He just got annoyed with me. Do you like your parents? They can't be that bad, because you're not that funny.
They're bananas. And always broke. They got divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last week. They hate each other. They always put me in the middle of it. I always wanted them to say, "We don't want you to suffer through this, so we're just going to handle it ourselves." They never would do it. They would always make me feel their pain all the time. I would never do that for my kids. Because it's like they._`.re kids. And no matter how many times I tell them to leave me out of it, they never do. Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.
I'll let you crash.
No, keep going. It's interesting. Tell me about your day job?
Alright. So... I work at a supermarket at the deli counter. I hate it, but the money's actually pretty good. Better than you'd think. But I'd rather do comedy full-time if I could. The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.
Hey man, you want to make me breakfast?
okay.
Do you know how to cook anything?
Eggs.
Okay, let's have some eggs. While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills.
What are you doing, man? Are those vitamins?
No. Medicine. I'm sick.
What do you got?
I've got some crazy blood disease. They think I'm going to die in six months to a year. Some weird thing, almost nobody has it. All these are experimental.
Are you fucking with me? That's not funny, man.
No, I'm telling you the truth.
I never heard that before. That would be a big deal.
I haven't told anybody yet. I don't think I'm going to.
You're not going to tell anybody? You told me.
Well it's easier with you because I don't know you. I don't feel weird around you. I don't want to be treated like a guy who's going to die.
I don't know, man. I don't think you want to go through this alone. I think you've got to tell people. Your family. Your friends.
Actually, the reason why I only told you is I need you to do me a favor.
What? Anything, man.
I can't imagine suffering through the final stages of this. So...I was going to ask you if you would be willing...to euthanize me.
What does that mean?
Kill me. I figured if I found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and I wouldn't have to suffer. I got a gun that is untraceable. And a silencer. And I thought maybe tonight, I would take a bunch of sleeping pills, and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head.
I can't do that!
I'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash. You'd be doing me a favor. It would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody.
Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at least take a little time to think about it?
Holy shit, you would do it. You were literally thinking about doing it!
You're an asshole.
I'm an asshole, you were about to kill me. For fifty grand! That's not even a lot of money.
You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer. While you're cooking me eggs.
That's not cool, man. You told me you're going to die and you want me to euthanize you. I almost had a heart attack.
Well, I actually am sick. And I'm not going to survive.
Don't do this. My friends do this all the time. They trick me, and then they trick me again. I'm very gullible. Don't do it.
I'm not putting you on, man. Just don't tell anyone. I mean that. I don't want people to know about this. I don't want to feel weird. Ira nods okay.
Are you religious? Does that give you any comfort?
Do you really think I'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you?
No.
Maybe later, Father Mulcahy.
That's so sad.
If it was me, I would tell everyone. Then everyone would kiss my ass. And take care of me. Tell me how much they love me.

He doesn't want to be that guy. He picked up two girls at a bar. Then he had sex with his. And then he came out and had sex with mine.
In front of you?
No.
So being terminally ill makes you a cock-blacker?
No, what I'm saying is...He's so lost right now that he's hiding from the world. And he's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women. And he doesn't want anyone to know but me.
Why you?
Because he doesn't know me. So he doesn't give a shit.
That's kind of insulting.
No, I think we had kind of an instant connection. The other roommate, JAY, walks by.
Shut up, Jay. Jay keeps walking.
I feel like he's crying out for help, and I can help him. He's made us so happy in our lives, this is our chance to do something from him during this time. There's a lot of wisdom we can take from this. What he's going through. We can apply it to our lives.
Like how to bang two chicks in the same night, even though you have a terminal disease?
No, what is life all about? What is important? How should we decide to live this precious life? REVEAL that Mark is crying.
Don't talk about this shit when we're high. It really freaks me out and it makes me sad and it scares me. I don't want to talk about this shit.
That's why we should talk about it! You can't run from it, man. This could make us into better people. This is an opportunity.
I don't want to talk about this shit until I'm 80. I'm 24 years old.
Well I'm going to fucking learn something. Mark cries even more.
When my grandfather died, we were in a room with no windows. And they said he was dead. And there was a candle. And it started flickering like he was blowing it out. But there were no windows.

We all thought that was him going to heaven.
You have to go through fire to get to heaven? That wasn't him going to heaven, that was him going to hell.
Fuck you guys. I was trying to open up. I'll never do it again. You're just being mean because I'm making twenty-five thousand dollars an episode.
Hello.
Hey. You want to see if we can get on-stage somewhere?
Sure.
I was thinking about it. I could throw you some money every week for coming up with new jokes for me. Maybe you can organize them in the computer, keep track of what I'm doing.
Absolutely. What do you want to pay me? They close the doors, drive off.
I'll throw you $1500 a week.
Okay, that could work. We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's life.
I was thinking maybe you should do some material about what you're going through, being sick. There could be something really powerful, and it would mean a lot to people, that you would share that with them.
I'm just doing stand-up to have fun, forget about it on stage. There's nothing funny about that.
It could be classic stuff. For the ages.
Fuck classic stuff. Idon't give a shit what people think of my shit when I'm dead. Why don't you wait till you're about to die and then you do a bit about it? I'll bet you're about-to-die shit will be funnier than my about-to-die shit.
I ordered your Roast Beef. And normally it's delicious. But this time I paid a price!
Well that's very nice of you. But I have one question for you. Can I get two sandwiches? George motions for Ira to do something.
Grandma! Get off the fucking phone. Don't run up my fucking bill.
This is a family matter! He can hit me if he wants. He's my grandson, and I love him! Now may I give you my name, so you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that? Can you say it back to me?
George? George? He walks through the house, finds George in bed. For the first time he seems sick.
Are you all right?
No, I had a bad night last night. I was sweating though the sheets, couldn't stop. So I got up, watched half of a season of The Wire and then I slept till...what time is it now?
It's three in the afternoon.
I wanted to get up and do something. But I don't think I have it in me. I may just go back to bed.
Well do you need anything?
Yeah, I need all sorts of things. But nothing you can get me. You should go up anyway. You were in a groove the other night, you don't want to get rusty.
I. .I. .can't anyway. I'm doing the late shift at the deli counter.
Really? How long you gonna keep that job for? I'm paying you good money. What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph's and sees you cutting turkey?
I know, I just want to be safe, make sure I can pay my bills. I don't like to be nervous about that shit.
I wasn't like you. I had a different theory. You've got to spend money to make money. Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt. Maybe we should go buy a Corvette. That'll make you try to be funnier.
so how much notice are you giving me?
Notice? I'm not giving you any notice. I'm just quitting.
You're supposed to give notice. That's what people do.
Why would I give you notice? I'm not trying to stay in Ralph's good graces. I'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph's.

I'm just quitting. You don't quit and then keep working for two weeks.
Well I don't have enough people to cover all your shifts, now I gotta cover them.
I wish I could help you, but I'll kill myself if I keep working here. It's not what I want to do. Maybe Gail can cover my shifts.
Gail can't work weekends, and my kid's birthday is this weekend. What am I supposed to do?
I don't know. Get someone to cover from a different Ralph's. There are thousands of them in Southern California. No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl? I'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph's from falling into chaos.
You're an asshole. You always thought you were slumming it here. Go tell your tucking fart jokes., Get the fuck out of here before I kick the shit out of you.
You know what? I'm glad you said that, because I was about to tell you I could work this weekend. What's your problem? I didn't say anything bad about you, I just said I didn't want to work for Ralph's anymore. Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him. Ira steps back a few feet.
I'll tell Dave. I'll tell Dave. I tried to do this politely. The thanks I get.
See you, Phyllis. You're nice.
Hey, Daisy.
Hey --
Ira.
I know.
I was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see Wilco at the Greek Theatre. You want to come? Are you into them at all?
I would love to come. That would be amazing.
Okay. I'll call you with the details. Hopefully I'll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered binoculars.
I don't care where the seats are. I just like to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts,
Perfect. Then I can play you their live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats. That won't work.

That wasn't funny at all. I'm gonna leave while I'm ahead right now. She smiles. He walks away.
George? Ira walks into George's bedroom. He hears something, pokes his head in. In the dark, he can barely see George making phoney calls by himself. Ira listens for awhile, not sure what to make of this. George doesn't see him.
(speaking like an old
I don't know! The thief has the card, why don't you ask the thief the number of the card! George hangs up the phone. He starts dialing.
Ah yes, I came into your comedy club tonight and I was very offended by the performer. I did not pay good money to have the so- called "comedian" shake my wife's hand, then smell it and say, "Did you have fish for dinner?" That is not my idea of entertainment. Ira leaves the room, feeling like he's intruded on a private moment.
I was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation... your condition.
No, no. IÃ¢â¬Â¢ don't want to do that.
I feel like maybe you're holding everything in and I can understand why you don't want to deal with it because why would anyone want to deal with it. But I bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends. Wouldn't it make you feel a lot better to get your affairs in order? What do people do at this moment Don't they have to do stuff?
I don't want to do anything. I just want to be in the moment and live every day the best I can. As soon as I confront it with everybody, everything's changed and I can't get back.
Everything has changed. At some point you're going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you. I'm sure there's a lot of business, estate issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll feel better than if you just deal with everything. Where are your parents?
P4y parents would drop dead if I told them what was happening. They're in their 80s. They don't have to go through this. I'll make sure they find out at the last possible second.
Friends?
I don't think I do. I thought I did. I got a lot of people I know, shoot the shit with, fuck around with. But I realized when this happened I'm not close to anyone. I had no one to call. My friendships are Hollywood friendships. When I was lying in bed I couldn't think of one person I wanted to share this with. Maybe it's me, maybe I never got close to anybody.
I think if you talk to people you'd find out a lot of people care about you. You're kind of old already, I mean, compared to me. I'm sure you touched a lot of people's lives. You can't spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your room.
The only reason I did that was because I couldn't sleep. And I had no one to call.
Well maybe that's the problem. Maybe if you told more people you'd have more people to call. You can't just talk to me about it, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You're the first person I've known who's sick. I'm not good at it. (eyes beginning to well
(his eyes begin to well
I'm sorry.
Seriously. I can't...I can't have you do that. George really begins to cry.
Please don't do that.
(tears streaming down his
That was first and last time. I'm not even crying anymore.

You're still crying.
I don't think I am. I think I'm not anymore. I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Okay, as long as we got that straight. George takes a napkin and puts it over his face.
I'm sorry, George. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to help you.
(his face still in the

I'd rather drop dead. of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a nightmare. This is a total nightmare.
Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on?
Yeah.
Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no.
Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of George's. He asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the receiver.
Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Ira slam the door.
I'm sorry. I have some news about George.
George sits with THREE COMEDIANS. They are all laughing and telling old sex stories from george's younger days. Ira sits with them and listens and laughs along.
So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it.
Admit it, you were masturbating.
And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh.
George is talking to an EX-MANAGER and his WIFE.
Allen Covert yells at George for abandoning him.
George is talking to his sister, LISA.
You have to tell mom and dad.
I will tell them, but right at the end. I don't want them to go through all this. I can't put them through this.
I wish I wasn't so mad at you. I want to be there for you, but I am so mad at you.
I wish I was a better brother.
You weren't even a brother. You just left when I was a little kid. You left me there all alone, and you never treated me like a sister again.
You live so far away. I visited you in Kansas a few years ago.
That was six years ago, and you were only there because you had a concert. My five-year-old has never even met you. George does not know what to say.
And I wanted to bring her, but then I thought she would just fall in love with you and get attached, and then what? I didn't want to do that to her.
Thanks a lot, pal. This is everything I didn't want to happen. It's like being at my own funeral.
Afterwards you'll be happy you did it.
No, I won't.
George talks to a FRIEND who rambles on and on talking about his own problems, ignoring George's.
Well, I really appreciate you coming by.
Exactly. Well, I really need to rest...
It was so good to see you. George stands up and exits the room. Ira walks over.
I think George is going to take a nap now.
A different FRIEND is talking about their own health issues. He goes on and on about his surgeries and treatments. George doesn't say a word.
George is talking to BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.
I guess so, but...

You need to shut the fuck up right now. Have you been browsing the self-help section at Barnes and Noble? Is this what you say in between songs these days? I'm going to go right now and delete all your songs off my iPod.
This is awful. Awful. I hate you for having me do this.
You have to, you have no choice. You're doing good. And you're almost done, don't worry.
Well what are we going to do when it's over, when we're done tomorrow? Because then I'm not talking to anyone.
I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere. You're still physically doing well, and that's not going to last forever. You should do something active. Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or something. Or do something crazy. Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or wherever they have mountains.

I don't know, I don't even ski, but you do. Maybe you should do something like that. Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more quietly. He's gotten good at this.
If it's too hard, we can just ski for an hour or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar. You can hit on hot ski instructors, and then I can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors. He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks.
Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the mountain air, fun to look at the mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even be here. We can hang out there as long as you want, I got nothing to do. Ira closes the door.
Thanks for coming down. You didn't have to do that, i appreciate it.
I wanted to, I wanted to see you.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you.
You don't have to be sorry, that was like 12 years ago. Everything worked out for the best. We see this hurts George.
I screwed everything up. I could have been married to you now.
Don't do this.
We could've had a family . I don't have a family, I'm all alone here.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what's happening to you.
You know, maybe I deserve it. I screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life. I cheated on you. For no reason at all. Just young and stupid. And selfish. I'm sorry.
Maybe I over reacted. I didn't have to leave you.
Yes you did. ANGLE ON Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes coffee.
And the funny thing is...my husband, he is on the road a lot for business. He did the same thing last year.
Did you leave him?
No. I have kids now.
See, that was my mistake. I should have had some kids with you before I cheated. she laughs.
You were the one and only magic relationship in. my life. She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace.
Me too. They cry, forehead to forehead.
There's never been anything like you before or since. I love Chris, but it's not the same. It's fine, maybe it isn't even fine, but we had something special.
I'm so sorry. I really loved you. And I do love you.
I love you too George. I wish there was something I could do.
Don't set me up for jokes like that. You're ruining the moment. She smiles. They hug.
Hey. How's it going?
Good. Mark walks out in a bathrobe.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were sleeping at your boyfriend's again tonight.
I guess it's been more than ten days.
It's been 21 days. I gave you an extra 11.
What are you guys talking about?
Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter, I don't give a shit. Leo walks in the front door.
I just fucking killed at the Improv. Bud Freidman fucking loves me. Leo realizes he's walked into the middle of an awkward moment.

They said they're gonna start giving me good spots on the weekends.
I've been getting good weekend spots.
Well, that's because they think if they book you, George will show up.
What's with you guys? You both want to fuck my mother too? What more do you want to do to me tonight? Ira walks away.
I really did kill. Did you guys just bone, or something?

I'm getting a little vibe here. It's getting me excited.
So now you're with Mark? You're his girl?
I just went out with him one night.
You got a lot accomplished in one night. How did this happen?
He invited me to a taping of his show and we hit it off.
Must have been a great episode. I should get a job on a shitty show so I can use it as foreplay.
What are you talking about? Don't treat me like that.
I am not treating you like anything. Do what you want. I don't give a shit. I'll go to Wilco alone.
What planet are you from? The one where everyone is perfect like you, you judgemental fuck?
How could you do that? I thought we were going out on a date.
We are going on a date. I didn't plan it. Am I not allowed to do stuff because we're going out on a .date? What the fuck's the matter with you?
I bought tickets to Wilco and I worked all week to get a reservation at a place that doesn't normally let people like me eat there. I just didn't see this coming. Yes, you're right. You can do anything you want. I'm glad this fucking happened, before I wasted the night with you. I didn't think you were that kind of person. That you would sleep with a guy like that.
He's your roommate. You don't like him?
No, I think he's a pussyhound.
Well, I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. I wasn't trying to hurt you. It just happened.
You got excited because he's the star of the show. You literally star-fucked.
Yes, you're right. I'm awful.
Give me a break. I don't even know you.
I told you I was going to give you 10 days. That was three weeks ago.
I thought you were joking.
I didn't know she actually mattered to you. We talk about girls we want to fuck all the time.
I just bought these two Wilco tickets. Wanna go?
I would, but I'm going with Tobey Maguire. He wants me to play his younger brother in some movie.
You know, I never got married. I never had kids. I didn't get to do a lot of things I thought I would do. But I was pretty fucking funny, right?
Come on, are you kidding me? We all want to be you. Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you. People love your shit.
Well, I made a lot of people laugh. I guess that's something.
It's a lot.
Yeah. I guess so. They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George getting big laughs with something really silly.
Look at that crazy motherfucker.
I never understood why people hiked before. I think I get it now.

I don't.
What are you doing?
I'm feeling good, so I'm going to the doctor.
You're not feeling good?
No, I'm feeling good. It's kind of weirding me out.

I don't feel sick at all, and it's scaring me. I feel like I'm just going to drop dead. Am I not going to feel bad at all, and then one day wake up dead? It's disconcerting.
Well what the fuck do I do now?
Ira's eyes are wide with shock.
Oh my god, oh my god! Ira goes to hug George, but it's a very awkward moment. Ira really wants a happy hug, but George is instantly uncomfortable.
I really want to thank you for your help through this time.
I was happy to help.
Well, you didn't have to, and you were really there for me. I was thinking, maybe we should write a movie together.
Uh-huh.
I feel like I've learned a lot, and I wanna use this good place I'm in right now to do something really creative. I would pay you, certainly. I make, you know, about a million dollars to write a script. I can't give you half, but maybe one hundred, two hundred grand, but we'll figure it out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
I thought a lot about my work when I was sick and I'm in sort of a strange place career-wise, because I'm normally the goofy, funny guy and I don't know if people are expecting a change from me. And I think people are expecting me to evolve, and it's important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why I'm not evolving.
It's always good to keep breaking new ground.
Is that something they taught you at the deli. I'm not asking you for your advice, I just though we could start trying to come up with an idea.
Well, I'm gonna start thinking. And...I'm really happy for you. Are you freaking out right now?
It's very strange. It's gonna take me a few days to process it, but it's a gift and I'm going to treat it that way.

I learned a lot from being sick and it's gonna help me make some good choices, and be a good person from now on.
And he thanked me for helping him, and I really think I was a help during this time. I'm not saying that's why he got better, but he definitely had good energy and I hear that helps your immune system.
He's going to pay you two hundred thousand dollars to write a movie script?
I don't know, he said one or two hundred thousand.
One or two hundred thousand? That's pretty vague. That's a wide range. I'd push him toward two hundred thousand if I were you.
Thank you for the advice, Bob. That's very helpful.
This is good because now you can help with your sister's college tuition.
What are you talking about?
Your younger sister got accepted to Boston University but, as you know, your father and I aren't in the position to pay for it.
So I have to? I just stopped working at a supermarket two weeks ago. I'm trying to create some financial stability for myself. The first time I make any real money, I can't just give it to her.
Well that's very selfish.
Well you guys went on a cruise to Greece last year. Maybe you shouldn't have gone, and saved for her college education.
Oh, so after all we've done for you, we can't have any fun? We should never take a vacation?
I had to drop out of college after two years because you couldn't pay for it. Now I have to pay for hers? Let her figure it out. Let her get a job.
I didn't realize I raised such a selfish boy. When I was young I would have done anything for my family.
Then sell your house. Move into a smaller house. Use the extra money to pay for her college. Or tell her to work for a year or two, make some money, then she can pay for her own college. No one helped me out, I'm just digging out from under now.
Don't get so high up on your horse with all your Hollywood friends. I don't like what you're turning into.
One good thing happens to me in my entire life, and you have to try and take it away and ruin it.
I don't even know where you came from.
Don't bother showing up for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is just for families.
Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come? It's just for us losers who don't have any family to eat with.
He's not gonna email back.
He's never gonna want to eat Thanksgiving with us. The computer BINGS. The guys scream in delight.
Sure. What time? Do you need me to bring anything? 3 O'clock at my apartment. Bring wine that we can't afford. The computer bings.
That's pretty much all wine on earth. See you then.

Email back and say If you can, bring that hot chick from your last movie. We definitely have room for her.
Well, then maybe just bring grain alcohol then. They all start laughing. The computer BINGS again.
Hey Faggots, I know what you're doing. Stop emailing me. It's not amusing anymore. They all start high--fiving.
He called us faggots!
What have you been up to? I haven't seen you at the Improv.
I've just been busy. Will you excuse me? Ira gets up, walks out of the room.
Hey, George. How are you? Come on in. Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on his neck.
Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in.
We're really glad you could come have Thanksgiving with us. It's a big thrill.
It's weird, I feel like the old guy in the room. When I started out I was always the young guy. It's strange how fast you become the old guy. And I feel exactly the same.
Well, you don't know us, but you're with friends and admirers.
I know you, I've watched your show. "'Nuff Said." It's a good show.
You don't have to lie to him. He knows it's not good.
No, it's good, it's cute. I like it.

I know it's not that funny, but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again.
Don't be ashamed, it's good. But what about that girl on the show? How old is she? Tell me she's 25.
No, she's 15.
Holy shit! I feel bad. I don't want to tell you what I did watching that show. Are you serious? She's 15?
No, she's actually 20.
Okay, good. Now I don't feel so bad. Their weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up.
It's kinda like 9/11. You know after 9/11 you kind of liked everybody? But then it went away. It's like that.
Did you think you were gonna go to heaven? Did you count up your sins?
I don't believe in any of that stuff, but I was hoping I was headed somewhere. I felt like I was.
Come on, Futoran, we're about to eat.
Well, it's easy to think that way until you're headed for the dirt. Then your mind opens up a little bit, you know? Maybe it's desperation, or maybe you just start to see more of the big plan. Luckily I got a little more time before I find out. Daisy pops her head into the room.
Food's ready.
May I say the prayer? Everyone nods yes.
Everyone hold hands. Thank you for the gifts this year. Thank you for And thank you for And hopefully next year I'll get to screw that girl on Mark's show. All our dreams will come true. You guys will get an apartment with less pubic hair on the toilet seat, you'll be able to afford a maid. Maybe next year you guys can get a better celebrity than me. Maybe Wolf Blitzer will come. I also pray that no one put their balls on this turkey, I'm kind of scared you guys are about to give me salmonella poisoning. I know this Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a normal Thanksgiving for you guys, but it's a very special one for me. I'm very glad to be here. I'm not that glad to be here with you, but I thank you for having me. I'm sure it will be very memorable for you. Now let's find out what Leo's balls taste like.
This guy wrote me some funny jokes for that Mac gig. I asked for some jokes and he sent me about a hundred. Seriously. This guy sent me jack shit. If you want to succeed you need a work ethic like Ira over here.
Why wouldn't I have sent you jokes? You didn't ask me for jokes.
Sure I did. I asked you and Ira to write me jokes and you flaked. Leo's eyes widen with anger.
Ira wrote this joke about Leopard, it was really funny. Do the joke, Ira.
I don't want to right now.
It was like, what's great about. Leopard is you can watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. This guy's fucking funny. Leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without saying anything. Ira watches him go, concerned.
You guys look like a cute couple, you should go out.
well, the truth is we had a date, but I went out with Mark first and he broke it off.
I didn't expect you to blurt it out like that. That was very honest of you.
If I didn't go out with every girl one of my friends slept with... let me put it another way. If none of my friends went out with girls I went out with, none of them would have gotten laid.
So, are you guys dating now?
No.
This is making me uncomfortable. The whole thing, it makes me uncomfortable.
You guys are young, why are you taking everything so seriously? As someone who's been through a lot recently, let me tell you something. The worst thing you can do is hold grudges and be judgmental. Everyone's making mistakes, everyone's screwing up. You guys are cute together. George points at Mark.
I know that Mark's not good in bed. Don't tell me he was a good lay. He can't have a big dick. Look at Ira. He's thick. He's gotta have a thick dick.
Actually, I have a really skinny vagina, so I'm not really into thick.
See? She's funny. She can take a joke, she's not sensitive. I think I'm falling in love with both of you.
I'm gonna walk away now, causing an awkward moment, that will be followed by a true moment, filled with chemistry. I'm walking away now. Let the awkwardness begin. George walks out of the room.
My brother's going to freak out that I met Davey. Did you go to the Wilco show?
I actually scalped them and made a hundred bucks.
Well at last you didn't lose any money on the deal.
I'm sorry I got so upset with you, because it shows you how much I like you, which is weird because we've hardly spoken. I understand all of that.
Well, attraction is all about smells, pheromones.
Well, you smell right to me. Daisy smiles at Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room. He charges right up to Ira, pissed off.
You're a fucking prick, You're a piece of shit thief motherfucker. You stole a job from me, you stole my joke.
You stole his joke?
He asked for me to write jokes too and you didn't tell me!
Uh...yes.
You .fucker!
I didn't think you would want to.
Why wouldn't I want to? What, I don't like money? I don't like private jets?
I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the gig. And you are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for myself.
It wasn't yours to keep for yourself. You lied to me.
I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything. Just get your shit, and get out of the apartment.
Are you serious?
You don't get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode. That is a terrible strategy.

I don't know what the fuck has happened to you--but my name is on the lease, and I don't want to live with it.
I never told Leo because I wanted the gig?
I didn't know you were fucking over your friend. Don't yell at me.
Well I fucking live with you now because he told me to leave.
He kicked you out for that.
He said friends don't lie and I'm fucking with his career.
Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you. That's kind of cool. I got you kicked out.
Fuck off.
This should be comfortable in here. This room is almost as big as your old apartment.
Thank you for letting me stay here.
No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me while I crash?
No. You want to come talk to me while I crash?
All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George closes his eyes.
I was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script "Making Amends."
Do you really think people want to see you make a movie about a guy who goes to AA but isn't really an alcoholic? He just needs the companionship? That's a pretty big left turn.
I got money. I want to challenge myself. You said you liked it.
You know, I read it four years ago. I need to read it again. I don't remember not liking it. I just can't tell you the studio will make it. Your last few movies didn't do so well.
I thought they did well overseas.
You always do well in Australia, but that's about it.
What if I do it for no money, just with back-end?
I don't know if that's going to cut it either. The head of the studio does a lot of drinking, I don't think he finds that whole area funny. Maybe if you commit to do another one of the Davey movies, I could tie it to that, so they have to do both.
I'vedone four Davey movies.They wantme to do another sequelto that?We don't even have ascript.
Wellthere's this great script goingaround town, Happy Holidays. Whichis about an immature 40 year old man who acts like a kid. In it he comes home for the holiday season for the first time in ten years. And havoc ensues. You get to make fun of Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah and Christmas and New Years. They say they can turn it into a Davey movie.
Could I at least shoot the Making Amends movie first?
No.
Maybe I'll just write something myself.
I wish you would. You've never been able to do it in the past. You always talk a big game about writing your own shit. But I've yet to see a script land on my desk.
See, the thing I was thinking, was...you always play an immature guy. What if the joke of the movie is you're incredibly smart, intellectual and well-mannered. You just go the opposite way with it.
There's nothing funny about being smart. All comedy comes from immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin. They were all immature. They were all knuckleheads. Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally? What's funny about that? What else you got?
I. .I gotta go through my notes.
I'm thinking about taking a gig, and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground.
Well we'll still write the script, right?
Yeah, if we can come up with an idea.
Let's just keep banging at it.
I can't. I've got a date.
You have a date? Who do you have a date with?
This woman my agent set me up with. She raises money for this environmental group. I guess she's like a normal person. I can't live here alone in this house forever. I need something of significance in my life. So I'm gonna go out on some dates. No pressure.
You know what you should do, just as an experiment? You should try and not fuck her?
Why would you say that?
Because you're always saying you don't know if women like you for who you are. You don't know if they like you because you have money or you're famous. Why not take some time and get to know them before ass-raping them. In a romantic way.
That's insulting. Don't take out your frustrations on me because you can't get laid by acting like I'm some sort of deviant. I'm an adult. I have adult sexual relationships. No one does what they don't want to do. Sex is how people decide if they like each other. I'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them.
See, you can't do it. You can't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them.
That's not true. I'm bored of sex, anyway. There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I haven't experimented with. There is nothing left to do. There is no nationalities I haven't.slept with, no age groups I haven't slept with. I'm fully ready for normal.
What nationalities have you slept with?
US. Canada. Mexico. England. France. Spain. North Korea. Burma. Rwanda. Kenya. Tibet. Serbia. Chechnya. Iran. The Green Zone. Darfur. The Killing Fields of Cambodia. Mongolia. What about you?
New Jersey. Do handjobs count? Because then also California.
You know, I haven't been out on a blind date, ever. This may be the first one.
Oh I go out on them all the time. I've been on a bunch of J Dates.
What's J Date?
It's a website where Jewish people find each other.
So it's just a list of all the Jewish people? I thought we didn't liked to be tracked and monitored like that. She looks at him, doesn't get the joke.
You know, because of the... holocaust.
It's just a great way for like- minded people to meet.
What if you don't like Jews? She just stares at him.
I'm joking. So, uh, I hear you raise uh money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying.
It is, because, fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books. We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act. You know, one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year.
See? That's why I still drive a big truck. I stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down.
I know you're joking, but it's a very serious situation. People like you do a lot of damage to the environment. Whether it's taking a private jet by yourself, or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses. Your carbon footprint is huge.
You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint? Big dick.
Come on. We're gonna go do a gig tonight. Up north. And you're gonna open up for me.
How big a theater?
I think two thousand.
You should have told me so I could have prepared. I've never played a place that big. How long do you want me to do?
Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can get there.
Shit.
Dress nice. Tickets are expensive.
I don't own anything nice.
How fucking up north is this?
Its near San Francisco.
So we have like five more hours to drive?
It's not that far. It's like two more movies.
I don't like how you made me your limo driver. It's weird you're in the back and I'm up here.
I'd sit up front but the DVD player is back here.
I can't even listen to the radio because you're watching the movie. Can I sit back there and you drive?
No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss the exit. We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie.
Holy shit!
What happened?
The monster showed himself.

Great.
Hey, you made it.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world, thanks for inviting me.
You remember Ira.
Hi Ira. Are you performing tonight?
I'm afraid so. I've been told if I'm good it warms the crowd, and if I'm bad it makes them want George more, so...
You look great. How are you feeling?
I'm hanging in there.
I thought a lot about you after I left.
Me too.
Well the show is going to start in a minute, I better get to my seat. I just wanted to say hi. Don't be too dirty tonight, you know that makes me uncomfortable.
Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have to do an hour and half. She laughs.
Come by after and give me the review.
Okay. Break a leg. She exits.
You didn't tell her that you're not sick anymore? Why wouldn't you tell her?
I need you to do something for me. After your set I gave you a seat right next to her. During the intermission I want yQ.u to tell her I'm not sick anymore.
Me? Why do you want me to tell her?
Because it's weird, and emotional. I think she'll handle it better if it comes from somebody else. And then I can talk to her about it afterwards.
That's weird.
She'll be happy. It's not weird. You're the bearer of good news.
You had to do this to me right before my set. Like I'm not nervous enough.
Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so good.
You seem surprised.
I don't know, you seemed so nervous. But you were really solid all the way though, and your ending hunk really murdered.
Thank you. Hopefully George won't be mad if I tired the audience out.
I don't think he has anything to worry about. They always go crazy for him. Before he got famous, he used to bomb all the time.

And that's when I think he was the funniest. And now that everyone knows him, it's a little too easy for him, I think. No one was funnier when the audience hated him than George. He loved it.
So you guys were dating right when he started doing well?
Yeah. But you always knew he was gonna do well. He had so much charisma. He would walk into a room and in ten minutes that whole room would be about him. Even before anyone knew who he was.
Where did you meet him?
I was the hat-check girl at the Improv. And I was acting. I used to do guest spots on all those shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly Hills 90210. I always played the bitch. I don't know why, but I was on the top of the bitch list.
You don't seem like a bitch.
That's because I was acting.
Sounds like fun days.
It was, for awhile. Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from a distance.
I don't know if you've heard, but it looks like George's medicine is working.
What do you mean?
Why didn't George tell me?
He just found out. He doesn't want to jinx it. He doesn't want people to get excited, and then have it come back again. The lights go down.

I thought everyone came to see me. George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of events. The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious, and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you could trust and spend your life with.
I really don't know what to say. It's not like you weren't good before, but your act is so much more sophisticated, but just as funny. I've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before. You used to say these goofy jokes. It was really something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself.
Thanks. A lot has happened. And at least I got some good jokes out of it.
Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm really glad I came.
Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow, I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out. I want to see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband.
My husband is actually in China for another week, or so. He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses break into that market. So you won't meet him this time, but it would be great if you came by. That would be fun. I'll give you the tour.
Okay. We'll come by in the morning.
Okay. An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have equal weight.
Bye. I'll see you then. She looks at Ira. As she exits--
You were good too.
Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow? The drive is long enough as it is. George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.
Here's your money for tonight. Good job.
I'm excited to see her ranch. I hear it's delightful.
Why couldn't we have gotten two different rooms?
What's the fun in that? You can go pay for your own room, I don't care.
So, what happened with you and Laura? You seem to get along so well. Why did you cheat on her?
I was young, stupid... and I liked fucking girls. Why do you think I cheated? You would do it too if anyone would fuck you.
How many times did you cheat on her?
Two or three times ...a week ...for a couple of years.
Jesus.
It was awful. There was even marriage talk. My parents didn't want me to do it because she wasn't Jewish. She was taking classes to convert, even. I mean, how cool is that? She was changing religions to be with me. She knew more about being a Jew than I did from those classes. She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong. George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.
And then one day, somebody told her, I don't know who. And that was that.
Why do you want to go see her tomorrow? We could do something productive like get some writing done.
I like her. I love her. I miss her. I just want to spend a little time with her. I know nothing will come of it. I just miss being around her. A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult movies.
Anything looking good to you?
I don't want to watch adult movies with you.
okay. You want to watch Juno?
Okay.
You okay, buddy?
Yeah, of course I am. Laura opens the door.
Hi? We've been waiting for you. Come on in.
This place is beautiful.
Thanks. We've been here for five years. I think I just finished decorating it. She leads them through the living room into a huge open kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade, chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.
Can I live here?
of course, you can clean the stables.
You have horses?
Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a real city boy. But for some reason he loves horses. Of course I'm lef t to take care of them. But yes, we have three horses.
That's crazy, owning a horse. I can't even keep a goldfish alive.
All right, well, we're ready for the big tour. I want to see how you live. Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the room and she's pissed.
Mom! You said you were coming back! We're playing American Idol, you're ruining the game! Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child. This complicates a situation he already thought was getting too complicated.
I'll come right up. This is my friend, George. And Ira.
It's my turn to sing and you're supposed to be the judge and you're not in there and I'm very angry!
How old are you?
Five. But I turn six very soon.
Really? Because I thought you were like nine, about to turn ten.
She's very pretty. I like your hair.
I'm so sick of people telling me they like my hair. George is clearly not that good with kids.
Okay. I do not like your hair.
Don't make fun of me.
He's just joking Ingrid.
My hair. I have curly hair too. Curly hair is the best.
Last week my mom straightened it and it almost went to the floor.
If you straighten my hair, I look crazy. I look like the killer from No Country for Old Men. Have you seen that movie? MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.
You guys left me all alone in the playroom! If you're gonna leave I'm just gonna go talk on the webcam with Caroline.
Don't be rude. This is Ira and George.
Oh, I know you. My mom watches your movies all the time. But most of them I'm not allowed to see. George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted.
Oh, really? Do you like them? Which one's your favorite?
I don't know. I don't really like the ones I'm allowed to see, but I think I would like the ones I'm not allowed to see. But she says I cant' see them till I'm sixteen.
Sixteen? Just fast-forward past the bad parts.
The whole thing is a bad part. George LAUGHS in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is getting uncomfortable with the subtext.
C'mon, let's finish the game.

You've got the best of both worlds. Rock it out take it slow. And then you rock out the show! Everyone applauds for her.
Okay. Now it's time to see what the judges say. I thought you had a lot of energy, you're clearly gonna make it to the final four, and I love your outfit. What do you think, Randy?
Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It was a little pitchy in places, but I dug it. I really dug it.
.I'm Simon, and I thought it was horrible. I don't how you made it this far in the competition.

I think Paula is drunk. You will never be American Idol.
Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to your sister. Say something nice.

You were good.
Okay, you're not Simon anymore. Simon, what did you think?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Paula. I think you're the one to beat. They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship.
Okay Mable, you're up. Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song "London Bridge."

I want to go down like London, London.
I told you not to do that. Simon, what do you think?
She was horrible! She's a terrible singer! She's inappropriate!
Okay, who's next? Randy?
I don't know, Dawg. It was a bad song choice. I'm not feeling it.
My turn. Get ready to be blown away.

Take me down to the paradise city. Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty. Oh, won't you please take me home.
Just an urchin livin' under the street, I'm a hard case that's tough to beat. I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat. I'll pay you at another time! Take it to the end of the line!
Boo!
Boo!
What? It's Paradise City, by Guns and Roses.
You sound like a girl!
Vote him off!
All right! Here we go. They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they drive. Ira looks over, concerned.
Mom! Mom! Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour.
Ira, Laura invited us to stay over for dinner.
But it's like a seven, eight hour drive home. If we stay for dinner, we're not going to get home till like four in the morning. George stares at Ira for a beat, then --
Don't worry, we'll figure it out. You have something to do in the morning?
No.
Then everything will be fine.
Me and George are gonna go to the supermarket and buy some food so I can cook dinner. You think you'll be okay watching the kids? It'll only take forty-five minutes.
Sure. I'm great with kids. I was a camp counselor for five years. Camp Winadu. Kids love me. I'm like a human teddy bear.
This town is so small and adorable. It's like out of a Demi Moore movie.
Clarke's company is about forty- five minutes from here. This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house. There's no traffic, there's one coffee house, one bookstore, one market. No crime. But after you've lived her a few years you hunger for another coffee shop, a bigger bookstore, and a little crime. It gets so boring. And it's such a small town, God forbid you miss one of you kid's soccer games, they put the scarlet letter on you.
it can't be that bad. You live on a pretty little ranch. You have horses, a duck. It must be a nice life.
We used to have so much fun. I don't think I have that much fun anymore. I don't like who I'm turning into. Is the fun over? I have to get up every morning at six, drive my kids to school and then I have 6 hours before I have to pick them up. I have to yell at them to do their homework, be a taskmaster, then I make them dinner.

It takes an hour to shower them and put them to bed. And then it's 8:30 and I pass out. And it's great, but tuck. And when both kids are done with high school I'll be 49 years old, and then I'll have probably 6 very healthy years, then I'll kind of slow down and then I'll be an old woman. And that was it. And it's great, but fuck.
I couldn't believe you moved out of LA. You were getting some good jobs as an actress. You got to play the bitch on Melrose Place for awhile and make out with Andrew Shue. That was pretty good. Do you miss it?
Yes. Being a mom is very fulfilling, but there are other parts of me and every once in awhile I go a little crazy.
How do you go crazy?
I just get bored and depressed. And you know how my PMS is kind of out of control. This little boy hit Ingrid in school, and his mom acted like she didn't care at all, so I told her to fuck off. They both laugh.
Oh, that must have gotten ugly. How long did that stay awkward for?

Always. That woman hates me. And I hate her. And now our kids really like each other, so it's really fucked up.
Maybe you weren't acting on Melrose Place.
Screw you.
And my husband cheated on me, said he did it once but I know because I learned from you, they do it once, they do it all the time. You either cheat or you don't.
well I don't anymore. I haven't cheated on anybody since you. I haven't even been in a committed relationship since you, so it's impossible for me to have cheated.
That's both flattering and deeply disturbing.
I thought a lot about you when I was sick, and I would do anything for another chance. I know it creates a mess, but I think it would be worth it. I think we both know it's what we should be doing. He kisses her.
We can't go the supermarket.
Why?
Because people will see us.
So? What's wrong with that?
Well it'll be weird because we're about to do something we shouldn't do.
If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney.

When is George gonna die?
George is gonna die?
Why would you say that?
I heard my mom talking to her friend about it on the phone and crying.
I don't want George to die.
What do you care? You just met him.
George is gonna be fine.
They told me my grandfather wouldn't die, but he did.
Here's the truth. George was really sick.

But he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now he's better. And he's gonna live a long time. The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved.
I think my mom's in love with him. Ira looks doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his popsicle sticks.
Does somebody in your family like sports? They start passionately making out, slamming into the flatscreens.
I really never thought I was going to see you again. I grieved for you like you were dead. They continue to kiss. Suddenly she stops.
I can't do this.
Then let's not do it. She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is he a good guy or a bad guy?
I gotta get back to the kids.
You're back. That was quick.
The town is beautiful.
Where are the groceries?
We decided ordering in might be a little more fun.
Food's here! All right, everybody. Let's sit down at the kitchen table. Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's CLARKS, Laura's husband.
Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you doing home?
The man I was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack, if you can believe that. So I decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings. George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting himself into.
Oh. Hello.
Hello.
Oh, Clarke. George had a performance last night in town, which I went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came by to say hello on their way out of town. There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man you think is dying.
It is really nice to meet you, George. Laura talks about you all the time, and we're obviously big fans of your movies.
Well, thank you. You've got a great family and a great home.
I'm so glad you're home, honey. Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.
What's taking so long with the pizza? Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears in the doorway.

This is really great pizza. Thank you very much.

It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so surprising because you can't get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you wouldn't think you could get it in Northern California. But this really tastes like New York pizza. A long pause.
Sounds like your business is going very well.
People never thought China would do this much business with us, you know, but it didn't seem like a risky proposition for me. They've got a billion people, we make all kinds of cool shit in America, they start finding out about it on the internet and what-not. Sooner or later they're gonna find a way to get our shit.
He speaks Chinese. For real. Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.
You don't think they want new mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm trying to get access into North Korea, no shit. That situation could chance overnight. That is a huge market waiting to be tapped. It's already starting in Cuba.
My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate. He was sickforweeks. He still has it. It'sthekind of thing you can't getridof, you have it for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant.
So, George. How are you holding up?
Uh...I'm hanging in there.
How are you feeling?
He's doing really well. He's been very strong.
It's a terrible situation. I'm so sorry.
I appreciate that.
He's been fighting the good fight. His doctors are taking very good care of him. Ira can believe this conversation is happening.
You're a tougher man than me. I don't know how I could go about my day with that hanging over my head.
It just makes you appreciate every moment. It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what's important in life.
Does anybody want seconds? Or should I bring out the desert?
I'd love desert. What do you have? Do you have any ice cream or cake, or anything like that? I have a real big sweet tooth right now. Why don't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now? I've got a better idea, I make a really good milkshake. We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen.
Do you know who might be able to help you? A Chinese doctor. Have you explored Eastern medicine at all?
Now's not the time to talk about this.
I'm trying to help the man.
No, I haven't.
Hey. I'm the last guy who would buy into that shit, but it works.
He really is the last guy who would buy into that shit.
Our country's only two hundred years old. The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out. How I got into it, I had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me some herbs that tasted like dogshit, but they worked.

I take herbs for my PMS. They really helped.
Daddy, you've been cursing a lot. You owe me a dollar for every curse. I think you owe me fifty dollars.
This conversation is scaring me. I don't want George to die.
You girls can go play in the other room. The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health. They don't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight off the disease. It works. I've seen it. I wish I could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country. Someone's gonna do it and make a fuck-load of money. Because these people get old, really old. You can't kill these people.
Either that or they're all young and they just look like shit. Clarke laughs.
This guy's funny. You should be opening up for this guy. Hey, who wants a drink?
I'm going to retire in seven years. I'm done. I'm playing golf for the next fifty years. Work hard now, then get out. That's my plan. I'm putting in the time. Then I'm getting the fuck out. I don't like working. I will do it. I like what it gets me. But I don't like it.
You ever see Laura act? She was quite an actress in her day.
George, stop.
That's what I hear. Can't say I watched that much 'Melrose Place' back in the day. She keeps telling me to watch the videos but, you know, I was never a big 'Party of Five' fan.
Well, I also ran a theatre company. And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed a lot for our family.
Okay, if you say so. The Mask was a funny fucking movie. You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in? 'There's Something About Mary.' Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and disrespect. They keep walking.
I love walking it off after a big meal.
It's beautiful here at night.
There's no pollution here like in LA so you can actually see the stars.
They are beautiful, but we have to get going. We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles.
You can't leave now, you won't get back until daylight. You should crash in the guest house. I'm sure it not as fancy pants as where you live, George, but it's better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel.

And if you want to hang out tomorrow I just installed six flatscreens, we can watch all the football games we want. And dog- racing from Florida. There's a big game tomorrow. Ira, you must have played some ball in your day.
No, I'm just big-boned.
We probably should get some rest before the drive. All right, show us to our quarters, sir.
You sure you can't stay?
We really do need to get back. I have to visit my mom. I can't miss it. It's her birthday. Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it. She's turning 65. It's very important we get back for it.
That's too bad, I wish you could stay.
I wish I could say I was gonna see you again, but I can't say that. His eyes start to mist up.
Clarke, don't. You don't need to do that.
You know what? I think I do need to do that. One thing I learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it's important to have an open heart, to live in the moment, and to speak the truth to each other. So I'd like to say to you, George, that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife's life. I really like you. And wish we had more time to get to know each other. And I wish you a peaceful end to your journey. And another great journey on the other side of it. Clarke hugs George.
I really don't know what to say. I re- ally don't know what to say.
That was beautiful, honey. Well let me walk them to the car. Ingrid walks over.
Don't be sad. Ira told us that his medicine is working and he's not sick anymore.
I think that was a secret. I don't think you were supposed to say that.
Mable, take Ingrid into the house.
Can we watch another SpongeBob movie? Atlantis.Squarepantis?
Yes. Go into the house and watch a movie now! Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house.
What the fuck is going on around here? Is that true?
I never said that he was still sick. He just took some medicine and it's looking better. You can't detect it in his blood, but it could come back.
Is it looking better? Or is he better? Is he sick anymore?
Well ...I don't how you define these things-I'm not... sure.
is something going on here? Are you getting your revenge on me while I'm away? I came clean with you, you can't come clean with me.
You know what? I don't know what I want now.
Oh shit. It's ON.
So this is what you want? Was he ever sick in the first place?
He was sick. He was very sick.
Because if this is what you want, I'll leave right now. I'm not going to play these games. I'm happy to leave. I'm not gonnna have you put me on the cross because I made some mistakes. You guys enjoy each other. I could give a fuck. If you need me, I'll be at my apartment in China. Clarke leaves.
What the fuck is going on? Did you guys do something?
We had sex in Clarke's office.
Why?
Because I love her. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
But she has two kids, she's married.
She's miserable. He cheated on her.
You cheated on her.
Yeah, but that was a long time ago. I've changed. You saw that douche bag. You don't think he's fucking geishas on every business trip?
He was trying to cure you with herbs. He seems like a great guy.
This is none of your fucking business. Just stay out of it.
I can't stay out of it. We took your car here. I have no way of leaving.
This shit is deeper than you understand. People get divorced. People make mistakes and then they fix them. That's how life works. It's not a big deal. I know you're still sad because your parents got divorced. Well get the fuck over it. Call a fucking cab and go home.
So what are we gonna do?
You're gonna sleep in Clarke's office. I'm gonna go talk to Laura.
On, there you are. I've been looking for you.
I've been going through all the bank statements, trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in mine.

Almost all the accounts are in his name. I wonder if he did that on purpose.
Are you smoking a joint?
Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows this stuff on a hill by her house. You want some?
No, that stuff makes me paranoid.
Not me. It makes me feel sharper, Some people get tired, I get more energy, more clear.
What's happening?
What's happening? Whatever we want to happen is gonna happen now. I'm free. I'm fucking free. Laura gets up, kisses him.
We're free.

Yeah, we're free. They start kissing again. She starts to moan loudly.
Not so loud, your kids are sleeping.
A tank could roll through this place, it wouldn't wake them up. They kiss some more. She moans louder.
Hey, Daisy. It's Ira.
I just wanted to talk to you because I'm in the middle of a terrible situation and I don't have anyone I can talk about it with. My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his mind.
Look, I know you think I have the moral code of some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm with George and he's hitting on his ex-girlfriend who's married now and has kids and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of freaking out. I think I'm having a panic attack.
Well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it.
Haha, very funny.
Well I guess they dated like ten years ago...

Jesus Christ, what time is it already?
It's 10:15 in the morning.
Oh my god. Really? I mean, this is fun, but I don't know how much I can take. Hopefully they'll take a nap at some point. I want to take a nap.
They don't look that tired. The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them.
Look what I did. I want this hung up on the wall. She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate for the wall a picture of herself choking and dying.
The food here made me sick.
Mama, I have to go to the bathroom. Come wipe my butt.
I have to talk to them for a minute. Mable, go wipe your sister's butt.
She can do it. She's almost six. That's weird. Ingrid and Mable walk off together.
I wet the bed til I was eleven. It wasn't even a mental thing. I just got relaxed when I was asleep.
I spoke to Clarke. He's going to fly back to China tonight. I was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting him there and telling him that when he comes back, he should find another place to live.
That's great. Are you okay doing that?
Yes. It's what I want. I just need to figure out when we would move down to LA. It might be better to let the kids finish out the school year because I have to apply to the private schools in LA, and I don't know if I missed the deadline. Then I'd have to look into the charter schools. Sometimes these private schools, if you give them a donation, they let your kids in. Maybe you can stay up here for part of the year if I can't make it happen.
Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie, or on tour or something, that would be great. Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on public displays of affection. He kisses back, but you can tell that he's very uncomfortable. They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly separate.
I made her wipe her own butt.
I did it, but I don't know if I did a good job. Look at what I drew. I drew a picture of you. Look? Show Mama. George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.
That's you. That's George. That's Mommy. And Daddy. And me. And Mable. That's all of us. We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands.
This is a small bookstore. They've only got one Philip Roth book. Didn't he write like fifty books?
So when are we going to go home? You're not talking at all about when we're going to go home.
She's going to talk to Clarke tonight, and then she's going to make a plan. We've got to get over that hurdle.
Are you okay with everything? This is happening pretty fast.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Okay.
I mean, she's cool, right?
She's nice. I don't really know her very well.
She was kind of cooler when I knew her back in the day. She's still hot, but she was crazy hot back then. Her attitude has changed a bit. With the kids and all. Back then she was really sexy, and all about fucking. I know she's busy with her life now, but it is a little different.
Yeah, well when you have two kids and a husband, and horses and ducks, it's not all about fucking.

That's just the hormones of youth. I'm all about fucking. But I don't expect to be when I get older. I'll be occasionally about fucking, which is normal. The fact that you're all about fucking now is the weird thing.
Well hopefully everything will work out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be.
What does that mean?
It means I'm going to give it a shot. I'm excited, but I'm not going to really know if it works until we're in it. I hope I'm just not in love with the person she used to be.
She's about to leave her husband for good. She has two kids. You're not sure this is going to work?
There's no way to ever be sure that anything's going to work! I couldn't live up here. She wants me to live up here. I don't think I can do it. Maybe a couple of weeks a year.
Well, she'll live with you.
Do you think she means that she's going to bring the kids too?
Of course. What else would she do?
I don't know, don't some men get custody of the kids? Or they split the custody? I like the kids, but I've never lived with kids before.

The young one's kind of cute, but I don't think I can stand the old one full time. There's too much going on there. But I could definitely tolerate the young one. She's cute. Maybe they can split kids. Maybe Clarke will take the annoying one. Ira just stares at him, not sure what to do.
I'll be back in an hour and a half, tops. And then it all begins.
Okay, call me if you need any backup.
I love you.
I.. . love you. The car drives off.
Okay, I'm going to go into the other room and watch some TV.
You don't want to hang with the kids?
Nah, I was going to watch four hockey games at once. I've never done that.
okay, but I've got to run out and grab some cigarettes.
But you don't smoke.
I never smoked in front of you because you were sick. But I do.
Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the fucking airport around here? Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in a panic. He can't make it work.
George! Help! George jumps up and runs to her. She is in the bathroom sitting on the toilet.
Can you wipe my butt?
Don't you know how to do it?
I don't do it good.

Okay.
How do you get to the fucking airport?!
Where are you, where are you? You have to come back here. I need your help. I don't know how to do this. He walks back to where the kids are. They are watching tv. All around the room are family pictures. He is beginning to feel bad about what is happening.
I think my mom and dad are getting a divorce. I don't want my parents to get divorced. All my friends' parents are divorced, and they're not happy.
Why would you say that?
I heard my mom talking to her friend. I listened through the wall. She was looking for a lawyer. He cheated on her. What does cheating mean? That he's going to marry someone else? Why don't they just try harder?
Laura, it's George. Come back to the house. Maybe you shouldn't do it. Maybe it's too early for this. Call the house.
I'm getting cigarettes.
I got lost. I don't know this town.
Well come back. I don't know how to take care of these kids, I'm not a camp counselor like you. These kids are on to me. The older one's too intense. She's troubled. She's like Damien, from the Omen. I need help.
Ok, I'll hurry back.
I'm sorry too. I love you so much. It was just a flirtation. It never went anywhere. It's just after you cheated on me, I felt so alone. And you were gone so often that I felt like our life doesn't work.
Then I have to make a change. I'll stop most of the traveling. There's nothing more important than you and the kids. Ira starts to turn to sneak away. Clarke sees him.
Ira! What's going on? What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm just headed back to Los Angeles. I've got some spots at the Improv I've got to do this weekend.
Oh, fuck.
You're headed back to Los Angeles? Then why are you at the International terminal?
This is the International terminal? I'm so confused, I've never been to this airport before.
Yeah, this is the Air China First Class Lounge. REVEAL that everyone else in the lounge is Chinese.
What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on, Laura?
I don't know what to say.
Tel- me the truth ! Just tell me the tri.t_h.;_
I came here to tell you that I wanted you to move out when you came home. But I realized this was a mistake, so I didn't say it. Please don't hold that against me. We've worked everything out. Everything is fine.
Who's watching the kids? Who's watching the fucking kids?
An adult is watching them.
Is George watching our fucking kids? I will kill him. Clarke runs off.
What the hell happened?
Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my life! You and George have to get the fuck out of my life. You are ruining everything!
Uh oh. Ira runs out of the lounge. Laura runs out also.
No, no, no! I'm here. I'm here.
George! Clarke is coming back to the house. He knows everything! I'm coming to get you. Be at the end of the driveway. No! Be at the next driveway over! To the north!
(angry-to Mable and
Are you two going to fight?
Ye s.
She's not happy. Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts style.
No one who's married is fucking happy. Leave us alone! You fucked up. You fucked it up with her a long time ago. Let it go or I will kill you. I will literally kill you till you're fucking dead. That disease didn't kill you. But I will kill you.
You shouldn't joke about my disease. That was very serious. Very scary. Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like martial arts hits.
What the hell is that? Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira.
Don't jump in. Whatever you do, don't jump in. I don't want your help!
Okay.
You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her. What kind of friend are you?
I am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy. You are out of control.
I didn't deserve what you did to me. You betrayed me !
When I got there, she was already kissing him. I never even had a chance to stop it. I didn't get to do anything!
Don't pretend you're fucking mad at each other, just to distract me so I won't beat your ass. Clarke pushes George.
You're gonna come to my house? You're gonna come to my fucking house? You have to get your own life. Leave us the fuck alone.
Don't hit me! I've been sick! They don't know. The medicine is working now, but I'm still sick. Clarke punches George.
What are you doing? I said to jump in!
You told me not to jump in.
That's what "don't jump in" means. It means "jump in." Help me! Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him.
You're a terrible fighter.
I know, that's why I became a comedian, because everyone used to beat me up! George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard, sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet. Laura runs into the middle of the scene.
Laura, tell Clarke to stop!
Clarke, please don't do this.
Don't tell me what I can and can not do.
Laura, tell him. Tell him you want to be with me now. Laura doesn't answer.
Laura?
Why did you have to come here and confuse me? Everything was fine before you came here. Now everything is all screwed up.
Laura, what's it going to be? Are you going with him, or are you going with me? Laura looks at Clarke.
With him.
Don't do this.
You fucked up my life. And now I fucked up yours. But just a little. Probably just for a day. She walks back into the house.
Hit the road before I put you through another round.
You cheated on her too!
Yeah, but we're married. We're going to work through this shit. You should have waited until you were married to cheat. It buys you another chance. Clarke punches George. Ira is on the ground. He doesn't get up.
She told me I was the love of her life. And she loves me more than she loves you!
When she said that, did she think you were dying?
Yeah!
Too bad you had to 'Live and find out it wasn't true. Leave my fucking family alone! Clarke punches him. George gets a punch in but it doesn't hurt Clarke. Clarke punches him again.
I can do this all night.
Stop Ira, you're hitting me too. Mable and Ingrid appear outside.
What are you guys doing?
What's happening? The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful.
We're just playing that's all.
We're wrestling. It's fun.
Are you bleeding?
No. We were just painting. I got some paint on my cheek.
Come on girls. Let's go inside. Mable and Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.
You know what sucks about this? I like your movies and now I can't watch them anymore. Clarke walks away, then walks back.
I'm sorry. That was mean. Through ail of this, I want you to know something. I'm glad that you're not sick, and I understand. And I forgive you. Clarke goes inside.
That was meaner than him punching you. That is a demented motherfucker. George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches at George's face and he stumbles back.
None of you fuckers can hurt me. George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the ground for a moment. Ira makes his-way free and gets up.
Get the hell off of me you psycho.
Drive me home.
No.
How are you gonna get home then?
Fine.
You are the most self involved person I have ever met.
Oh yeah?
No matter what the situation, no matter how many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy. You're always going to be miserable. You are a bottomless pit. A bottomless wound.
What about you? You are just a lackey. Who are you to judge me? You tried to screw me over, after all I. have done for you.
I am not responsible for you. You wanted me to sit back and destroy this woman's life? Help you cheat on her? You put me in a terrible position. I don't give a fuck, go fuck yourself.
Lacky.
You made me the tacky? I'm not a lacky, it's a job.
It's not a job, you're a tacky. You're not even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad.
Who cares? If being funny means being like you, I rather be a little less funny.
Mission accomplished.
You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die.
I'm not going anywhere!
Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything!
Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door.
Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a huge mistake.
Wake me when we get home. George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed.
okay, I'm getting out. You have to drive yourself home. I'm getting out here.
Why didn't you drive me to my house?
Because then I'd still have your car.
You'll drop it off later.
There is no later! I'm not going to ever talk to you again. So I don't want your car.
So that's how it's going to be.
We rented out your room to Jay. But you can crash on the couch if you want.
Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch.
Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way for a while.
Thanks. The MANAGER walks over.
Hey Ira, Federman got in a car accident. Do you want to take his spot? George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age. This young man has clearly taken his place.
Hey, how's it going?
Hey George.
This is Randy. He's funny, you'd like his stuff. It's smart.
I'm sure I would. I look forward to seeing it. Are you going on tonight?
Do you want to go up? Ira was gonna take Federman's spot, but we can get you up if you want to?
No, that's ok. I don't want to take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna hang out tonight.
I made it myself this morning.
I stake my reputation on it.
Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad. The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal George standing there, holding his ticket.
Do you have any turkey that's hormone-free?
Yes we do.
So this is where you work.
Back in the saddle.
I thought we were writing a screenplay.
Well, you're not a very good writing partner.
Or any kind of partner. You want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me? They give you breaks around here?
In my travels, I have learned a lot about Asia and Buddhism. And I would like to be in the moment now with you, and to tell you how sorry I am, and how much I have appreciated your friendship. And even if we are not friends in the future, I wish you well on your journey. Ira laughs.
That guy was a douche-bag.
But also kind of cool. It's a very weird combination.
He was going to heal you with those herbs, man. You get sick again, you should call that guy.
I think most of what you said to me was true. And I really am sorry. I think I'm still not very healthy...in my brain.
It's all right, man. You've been through a lot.
Well, I appreciate you trying to help me. Even though it was kind of an impossible task.
Is everything going okay? How are you doing?
I am not doing well, but things have certainly been worse. So, I will be fine.
You were good the other night. I hear you're getting regular spots now.
I'm actually going up tonight.
Really? Any new jokes you're working on?
Yeah, I've been trying to get off my ass and do some writing.
What do you got? Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never asked this before.
I was thinking about doing a bit about how I'm not very good looking, but I'm not bad looking, but I'm just good-looking enough that if I had a good personality, it might put me over the top.
You should do something about how, when you date a girl, and you feel really good and she likes you, and then you see pictures of all her ex- boyfriends, and they're all really goofy-looking guys, and it's not that you're good looking, it's just that in this psychotic girl's eyes, you're good looking?
And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou Costello.
Why don't you say Dom Deluise? it's a more current reference.
More current? What year was Cannonball Run, 1978?
Okay, okay. What else you got?
I was going to talk about how I haven't had sex in so long, that I can't even remember my previous sexual experiences so I can masturbate to them.
You should say, now when I masturbate, I have to think about the last time I masturbated.
That's a good one. You can write.
You know, I always wanted to be part of the comedy field. As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...
FADE TO:
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. At-at-at-at-at. At-at- at-at--
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
Okay.
At-at-at-at-at.
Knock it off!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
No you're not.
The Iraqis are that way. Those are our troops you're shooting at.
You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting.
Blow me.
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
People are suffering.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
That's 'cause the Afganis weren't smart enough to be sitting on top of oil. People suffering is one thing, but when the Yuppies aren't going to have enough gas for their BMWs it's time to break out the tanks. Come on. Pack up. We've got a whole lot of nothing to patrol.
We ought to kick their asses. Either way we ought to.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Oh yeah. Accidently.
I'm sorry. My foot accidently jumped up in the air where you could see the bottom of it. I hate it when that happens.
Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Like learning Arabic? You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here. You don't learn it in a couple of weeks. I studied it in high school.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
I thought it would be good to know.
Yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug.
Hey, Jaeger. Why don't you try this Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib.
What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.
Don't even try it. You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Blow me. Have I said that to you guys recently? Blow me.
What is this?
Hey, Wes. Wes!
What is this?
Now you need me.
What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Can you eat it? If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Ask him what it is.
He says it's a box.
Yeah, you're funny.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
For real? A treasure?
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
I could.
You could turn on a light if someone put your hand on the switch.
Well, that showed me. Now, can we eat?
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
You will. You'll get it.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Jaeger?
What?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Yeah. So?
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting--
What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It doesn't mean anything.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Okay, so we're going to war. We're supposed to go to war. We're soldiers, that's what we do. The guns, the tanks, the planes; you're just now getting the hint we're in the war business?
Jaeger?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box. I've got a treasure to find.
FADE TO:
FADE TO:
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
At-at-at-at-at.
This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
At-at-at-at-at.
Will you knock it off! Damn, man. You're going to annoy the Iraqis into submission.
This is stupid. It's going on a month now. How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards? They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
You know what, Wes? If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
You all want to lay off? God. I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
OH MY GOD!
What!? What!?
I did it! I got the box open.
You almost got yourself shot, that's what you did.
What's inside?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's a container. Break the seal.
Go on, man.
Paper.
It's a fortune box.
What's it say?
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
It's a drawing, or something. Some kind of art.
Looks like something a kid would do.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
There you go, Jaeger. Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
You think?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think. You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes. Let's get out of here. We got sand to protect.
Woods.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
A map? All I got is maps. I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here. What kind of map you need? Topographical, geographical, thermal?
I don't know. A map map.
A map map.
That shouldn't be too hard to read. Iraq is the pink thing.
I could use some recon photos too.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
The photos.
Some good ones.
They're all good ones. Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
I don't know.
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
Yeah. You figure out how to win the war be sure to let us know.
No that's okay. I'm gonna...I'm doing some...
FADE TO:
FADE TO:
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt.
Everybody's got a job to do. Figure it this way At least you get to go home alive.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Hey, look at this!
That's it. It's over. Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
A casual one.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
We...we could go home with something else.
What?
With...with millions. Millions of dollars.
What are you talking about?
Don't even. You're not going to show me that tired map.
Wait. Wait.
I think you've got some issues to deal with. Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me! I've been doing some reading. In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks. It became part of the Ottoman empire. When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. I read about this, man. I read about it.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff.
The Turks invaded, yeah. I guess people would have hidden what they had. But that doesn't mean what was in that box is--
Looks at this! Look at it! The drawing is a map of this area right here. You can see it. The geography, the landmarks. It's the same area.
And you know what that area is? It's Iraq. IRAQ! We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm. Maybe you've read about it.
What we're doing is kicking ass. For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews. The war is over. We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's right here. This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos. There're no troops there, no fighting--
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to--
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
It's real. I'm telling you, it's real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Epps, tell him.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here? 'Cause I got tired of being president of GM? If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
It's desertion.
Deserting what? What the hell are we deserting?
It's war. People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
But we all got to be in for this. We all go, or we do nothing.
Epps, you're smarter than this. Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
You know it's real. You know it's real, and you know it's there. You know it.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
If you say that, then I say you don't know Second Lieutenant Epps very well, do you?
God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't.
Yes!
It's going to be cool, Wes. It's all all right.
We go, we get rich, we go home. It's that easy.
Yeah. That easy.
To strains of Hendrix's Wait Until Tomorrow the Humvee cuts across the desert kicking up plumes of loose sand. It looks more a dune buggy out for a joy ride than a military vehicle.
Now this is war.
Roger that.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Hand me the navicom.
Hold on boys and girls...hold on...
Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.
Oh, God.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
What?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Oh, no.
Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is.
No, please, not again.
Nooooooooo!
Came on, I'm serious. Knock it off.
The Hummer hits yet another dune and takes flight.
This isn't funny, all right? I mean it.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
If! If there's a treasure.
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Yeah! Gold! How much?
How the hell should I know how much?
But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
If there's gold. If!
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Third. What you're going to do with your third.
Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet.
A car? You're going to buy a car?
This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
A car is not just a car where I come from. I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
What are you going to do with your third?
Invest it.
Oh, that's fun.
It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
What's that?
Take the binoculars.
Wh-what do you think--
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
Iraqis.
Oh, God!
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us. We run, they chase.
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do!?
We're going to keep driving.
They'll shoot us!
We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
They're not going to--
It's the only way. We drive!
Wave at them. Don't look, just wave.
Yeah! Yeah!
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
You see that? Right by us. They went right by. You had them Epps; you called it.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy. You're cool.
They stopped.
Wha...
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
They stopped, and they've turned around.
Go, go, go!
Shoot them!
Shoot 'em!
Steady it out!
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
I got him! You see that, I nailed him!
Damn it!
Wes, take the wheel.
Take it!
Keep it steady.
Damn it! I said keep it steady.
Shoot...shoot!
SHOOT!
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We got to get out of here.
We have to go back.
We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for.
We just about got killed. You know what happened? We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for damage.
You're crazy, you know that? You're insane!
You know that, right? You know he's sick?
They shouldn't have been here.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
We're not going back, are we?
You bastard! You're trying to get us killed.
I'm trying to get us paid. I'm trying to get us all paid! As long as there's a chance something is out there we go on. There's not going to be anymore trouble. If there is, we go back, but there won't be.
You'll feel different after we find the treasure. Money has away of making people feel different.
She okay?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
FADE TO:
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I know. I know. But I'm saying, if they knew. We're going to be millionaires, man. Millionaires!
It'd make their heads explode.
Millionaires, man.
Ahh, there it is. There it is. You know it.
Money, money, money, money...MONEY.
What are you doing.
Low on gas. Got to refill.
Jaeger...JAEGER!
Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight. I told you to check for damage.
...I know.
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it. I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
...You stupid son of a bitch.
Get off him.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
We're not stranded. We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Then lets go back while we still can.
As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway. We're not that far. We can make it.
What do we do with the Humvee?
We leave it.
What if someone takes it?
Who? Who's going to take it. We mark the location with the navicom, we can come right back to this spot.
You two don't even know how crazy you are. You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really? What is that, an order, private?
You have to go with us. You can't walk back...
Load what you can; water, tools, weapons. Anything you think we might need.
Who's he kidding? He wants it as bad as we do. We're going to be fat, Epps. As soon as we get back to Saudivillie you and me are going to--
We're going to keep going 'cause I want some of whatever's out there. But you ever pull something like trying to get my ass stranded out here again, and I'll kill you myself. You got that?
SAY IT!
I got that...sir.
A long line of footprints works their way through the sand up to Epps, Jaeger, and Wes. Epps and Wes trek side by side.
Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't have to go so fast.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Yeah. I know. I'm with you.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. Just a sip.
You can catch up.
Yeah...I'm right behind you.
Thanks for straightening out Jaeger.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this. But if we do it, we do it right. I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
He's not so--
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
How tough you have to be to make the army? All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Look at him. We ought to just leave him behind.
Like he said People get lost in wars all the time. And out here? Out here there are eight million ways to die.
Okay, so he was riding you. Get over it.
I'm just talking.
Can't even slow up for me. Wasn't for me they wouldn't even be here. I'm the one that found the map. Should have just come by myself. Should've. Shouldn't even cut them in. Shouldn't.
Epps...
Epps!
What!?
Mine.
What?
Mine. Land mine!
I stepped on a land mine!
You didn't step on any mine.
I heard it click.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
I heard it.
Maybe it's just a can, or something.
JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE. SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE!
Paranoid, that's your problem. You're just paranoid. Why'd the paranoid one have to find the map?
Oh, God! Oh God!
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool.
Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
I said be cool, all right? Now be cool!
What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay? Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up. Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Epps...
Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
There's a way.
Epps...
Can't do it. Can't do it, and keep him alive.
I said nobody dies. Nobody dies.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
Break it out.
My leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
When we start running suck up your breath. You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Don't let me die, Epps. I don't want to die.
What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
You just go when I say go.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Ready?
Yeah.
GO!
Oh, God. Oh, God!
His feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball, but still get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground several feet from the explosion.
I'm all right. Oh, Jesus, I'm all right.
The map okay?
We see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground. It looks like something has been dragged through the sand. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE TRACKS TO EPPS, WES AND JAEGER who crawl on their bellies. They thrust knifes into the sand before them searching for mines. We get the feeling they've been at this for awhile.
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
You want to crawl, crawl.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
You don't know that. It could be a trick.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
Get up and give me the maps.
We're on course. Northeast, twenty-eight degrees. When we hit the base of the mountain we'll find a pass. I can see it on the recon photo. Shouldn't be too hard to traverse. That'll take us to the top and...
This. Whatever it is.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
It better be.
The map.
The map.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand?
Yeah, I understand. Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. That's a sweet deal.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Quiet!
I don't hear any--
Shut up and listen!
Gunfire.
Don't!
It's a fire fight.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What is it?
What is it?
Iraqis. A bunch of them.
What are they doing here?
Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Maybe they're looking for gold.
Jesus! What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis. Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
They're doing more than slapping.
The Shi'ites are on our side? I didn't know that.
Is there anything you do know?
I know you're a pussy. I know that.
All right. Let's get out of here.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
So?
We have to do something.
There's nothing we can do.
We can fight. That's what we're here for To fight the Iraqis. To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
I didn't sign up to help any Shi'ites. All we were supposed to do is get the Iraqis out of Kuwait, and if we aren't doing that then all bets are off.
We carrying any ordinance?
Some extra grenades. A Claymore.
Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds.
So good bye, Shi'ites. Thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you. But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
We can't just go off and--
There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
This is it. We're right on target.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
We're not going to find anything standing here. Let's get to climbing.
Not much of a pass.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
Picks up again just on the other side.
Think we can make it?
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Looks like we make it.
The US Army Always an adventure.
Let me see the map.
Should be easy going from here. Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
What do you figure it to be?
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
X marks the spot.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Basically. But the map has been pretty precise so far. I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Take cover!
Let's hit 'em!
Cover me.
Clear.
Where'd they go?
I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about--
Weird they didn't chase us.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
What's weird is how they disappeared. Doesn't make sense. Doesn't...
Scatter!
Where is it? Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
Just stay down.
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
So we wait.
If they land--
If they land, we can take them. If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Missile!
Move!
Epps!
They want us to surrender.
Yeah, I'll surrender.
Get down!
Oh, God...
Yeah. Just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?
FADE TO:
What do you think?
Lines up with the map and the photos.
We're right where we should be.
I sure don't see much place else around here to hide anything.
Can't see anything.
It's got a bottom.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
All right. Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting. Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What am I supposed to do?
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
Nothing.
A whole lot of nothing.
So where do we start?
Wherever you want.
Their shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt. They look like they've been digging for quite some time.
Hey...Hey! Sun's going down. Epps! Jaeger! It's getting dark up here.
Epps!
I heard!
He rolls over and scoffs.
There's nothing down there.
Epps notices Jaeger just sitting there.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Get up off your ass and dig!
What's the point? There's nothing here. The map's a fake. Christ, even I see that now. We're just wasting our time. We might as well give up and--
You listen to me. The whole reason we're here is because of you and that map of yours. I didn't do all this for nothing, and I'm not leaving with nothing. If you think for a second I'm giving up just 'cause you're too tired to turn over some dirt, then you don't know John Epps too well, do you? So you dig, and you keep on digging 'til I say you don't have to dig anymore.
He can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down.
What are you doing...? What the hell are you doing down there?
They fight on; down and dirty. Locked together they roll around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand. They smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness. At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger. He lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaeger's skull. All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow.
Must be a compartment.
I feel air. Probably opens up outside somewhere. That's where the light comes from. Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
The white dot; light in the dark.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's giving.
Jesus Christ!
No, don't shoot!
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
Yelling down
What the hell are you doing!?

I think we found something.
He leans over the crevice.
What is it? What'd you find?
Incredulous himself:
Gold. It's gold.
IT'S GOLD!
His lips flutter a bit before they land on the word
Gold...
They scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through their fingers.
It's not like I figured. It's cold. And it's heavier than I imagined.
I wouldn't know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
You don't have to imagine it. Not anymore. Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
Wes!
Wes catches the coin. He turns it over in his fingers. He smiles, and there's nothing pleasant about it.
Wes, thrown down a pack.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins. Wes!? We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
Ready when you are.
Wait.
What?
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
What's to stop him if he wanted to? All he has to do is cut the line...
You ready?
All right. I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
Why do I have to stay down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Someone's got to send the gold up. It can't get on the line by itself.
Why's it got to be me?
What are you doing? You ready?
All right. You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.
If you're even thinking about leaving me down here, you better think again.
Wes, I'm coming up.
Okay!
Wes? Jaeger?
Jaeger?
Jaeger!?
What the hell took so long.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn't seem that long.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
Not losing trust, are you?
It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about the gold?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
What if we get separated? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Wes might be right about that.
It stays as it is. We're halfway home now. Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
You got no reason to do that!
I told you When I straighten someone out they stay straightened. This is how it works Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
Yeah. Sure. That sounds like a plan to me.
You got no reason to hit me. I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Then get up and do something about it.
Then just lay there and bleed.
FADE TO:
Stay down. Stay the hell down, or I will rip your stinking head off!
What the hell?
I caught him! I caught him trying to steal the gold.
Get off him.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Get off him!
What happened?
I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
With what? He doesn't have a weapon.
He's a soldier. He doesn't need a weapon. He's got rocks. He's got bare hands.
Shut up!
Stop it!
I told you; don't push me around.
Tell me what he's saying.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
He lived through that?
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Why'd he come in our camp.
Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
He...he could have been watching us.
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
Doesn't matter. Whatever he wanted he didn't get it. We've got no need staying around here. It's light enough. Let's pack up and head out.
What about him? We...we have to do something.
We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
You don't know he isn't.
So we'll take him with us. At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water. And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
We don't leave him, we don't take him with us. What does that leave?
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We're at war.
We are not at war! You and I and Jaeger are AWOL. We have no authority--
He tried to kill us. If not just now, then in the helicopter. That's all the authority I need.
We don't need to do this. We got the gold, all right? Let's just get out of here.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
Get out of my way.
For Christ's sake, we don't need this. Let's just go. Let's just...let's just get out of here.
Shut up! Shut the hell up!
He's getting away!
He stands, smoke curling from the muzzle of his M-16 like a white snake, having just send the Iraqi some bullets special delivery.
I had to. You saw how he ran. Would have given us away. I had to.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
You want to say some words?
Go to hell. How are those words?
We should head Northeast.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. We're heading Northeast.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
We been down this road. I told you how it is. Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
What if I do?
What if I do?
You talk loud, and don't even have a big stick to back it up with.
Something happens to me I let go of this grenade. I go, and I take the navicom with me. And how do you suppose you're going to find your way back to the Hummer, when you won't even know what's up or down. It's a big country, and you could be heading for the allies, or wandering right into Bhagdad. That's if you don't die of thirst before you even get that far. How you like my stick now?
Why don't you put the gun down, all right, Wes? You put the gun down and Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade. Won't you Epps?
I'm starting to think you're a real bitch, you know that?
THE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness. SMOKE
You're going to burn up in those.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. That's why they wear them.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Murder, or a combat action? It's hard to tell them apart?
You saw how he ran didn't you? First chance he got he ran out. Would have gone straight to his CO, told him all about the gold. What do you think would have happened then, huh? Then what do you think would have happened? Two thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on us. You ought to thank me for killing him. I'll get a medal for it. Watch and see if I don't get a medal.
What the hell...?
Help! Help me!
Help me!
For Christ's Sake, Jaeger! Help me! Help me!
Wes...Wes!
The navicom!
What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!?
We'll find our way.
How!?
We'll find our way! We'll...
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
And let me guess who is.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
What about Jaeger?
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps.
{Sneering) You know, Jaeger, you really are a bitch.
You die!
We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him. He was going to kill you. He was one blink away from it. He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
It's a helicopter.
There.
Ours, or theirs?
Ours, or theirs?
Ours. It's one of ours. We've got to signal them; let them know we're down here.
No.
We need something A flare, a signal mirror.
No.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
They'll search the pack.
They'll find the gold.
We're lost, you understand that? We've got no navicom, and no means to find a way back. So right now I don't give a damn about the gold because if we don't get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all it's going to be good for is buying us tombstones.
I can't do it, Epps. Not when we're so close. I can't let you ruin everything.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
Sit down, Epps.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah. Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sure.
Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
What? Yeah.
Epps?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now.
I never had anything before, Epps. I never was anybody. Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins. When I was in high school I used to--
Hey, you know what? Can I be honest with you? Right now I'm not all that interested in how you're messed up 'cause you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday. What I'm interested in is how I can keep from getting dead. And listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasn't good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn thing to help keep me alive. So do me a favor; either shut up, or...just shut up.
Sorry.
Damn.
What do you think our chances are?
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that. But we won't make another day otherwise.
Wonder how the war's going?
It's got to be going better than this..
We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick.
You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.
Okay. Then we go this way.
Epps and Jaeger make the long march across the sand. There's so much nothing out there it's maddening.
Epps drops down in the sand. He lets his pack slide fram his back, then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig. He puts his pack back on and struggles to his feet. As Jaeger crosses he takes Epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him up. The two wade on.
Getting cold.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal.
You listen to me. If, if we get out of this I don't care what you do with your share, but until then you've only got one thing to think about and that's staying alive. So you leave that gold alone, or you and I are going to have to have a serious talk.
Look.
What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Epps.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Epps. What if they're not Saudi.
If it's a checkpoint, it could be Iraqi.
We've got no cboice. Either way, we've got no choice.
Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile. Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war. They don't want any trouble.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us. Probably.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Probably.
Hellooooo--
Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib! Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!
What did you say?
I don't know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must be Saudis. It's a Saudi checkpoint. Oh sweet, Jesus. Come on. Come on!
Oh, man, this is good. What do you think the chances are they've got a whirlpool in this place?
Oh, God...
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
What are we going to do?
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Can't you--
I don't have a weapon.
Don't go bitch on me now! You were going to kill me. Kill them!
I just said I would. I don't think I--
Shoot them!
Shoot them, Jaeger! SHOOT THEM!
Let's get some sleep.
FADE TO:
Epp...Epps! There's someone at the window!
An Iraqi?
I don't know. He didn't have a uniform on. He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
See anything?
Nothing.
What do we do?
We can't stay here. Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up. Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
To where?
Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
Ready?
Look!
What do we do?
We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Jesus! How many of them are there?
I don't like this. Let's go.
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
...Wes...?
You were shot. We were standing right there, you were shot!
In the flack jacket. Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile. 'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
We thought--
YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert. They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost. It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something. And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis. See how I mean?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes--
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth. It's just the Shi'ites don't know that. I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Tell me something, Wes. Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid? Jaeger says you're crazy.
I didn't say that. I never said--
Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. I had respect for you.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that. It doesn't change me respecting you. And now you let me down. I expected more from you, you know? I really did. I expected you to--
You expect this?
Get the gold!
Now let's try things another way. Let's try this You and me and Jaeger are going to walk out of here. We're going to walk out all smiling and friendly so your little Shi'ite buddies won't suspect a thing. Then we're going to hop on some horses, and ride away, and live happily ever after. It's all going to happen just like that, because if it doesn't then I'm going to gut you like a fat pig. You understand me...soldier?
I'll take that as a yes.
Get the water.
They'll kill you. You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Can you ride a horse?
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Don't say anything.
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
You answer him, but you answer him wrong and you're going to be staring at your insides while you're dying.
Bastard!
Stop them!
They coming?
Oh, yeah. They're coming.
Ride for the hills. We'll try to lose them.
We lost them!
Which way?
Which way do we go!?
We go this way.
Jaeger!
The gold; give it to me.
Give it to me!
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Sure. Whatever you want. For old time sake.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Damn it. We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that. When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions. I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
We had a deal. No one touches the gold until we're out of here. No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You shouldn't think about things like that. It'll just make you crazy.
FADE TO:
Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.
How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.
Epps.
Yeah.
I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Thanks.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I...you know...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Don't make so much out of it. Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive. Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had. I'm no better than anybody else. I've just been busier.
Epps?
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
I don't know.
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
How the hell should I know?
Australia.
What?
I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
Well, this is it. We get the car, find some Americans. We find Americans we'll be all right.
We'll make up some kind of lie. They won't find the gold.
Okay. See you in a minute.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He'll slow down.
He's not slowing.
He's going to slow down.
Epps...Epps!
Aw, damn!
You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Y-yes.
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
You see that? Gold. You take us to the Americans, and we'll give you another one. Now drive.
You are Americans, yes?
We didn't not all want this war, do you know? We didn't not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in Kuwait. Now your army crushes us. So few days, and so many have died. And many fear we will all die. Please tell this to your people We did not want this war.
I have a brother in our army. When I take you back, will you look for him? If he is still alive, will you look for him and take care of him?
Yeah. We'll look for him.
Look at this.
Iraqis. They are fleeing from Kuwait, from your military.
See if you can't drive around this.
What the hell are they doing? There're civilians in there.
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT! THEY'RE CIVILIANS!
The gold!
No!
FADE TO:
I'm sorry, I guess. Not for looking for the gold, or leaving my post. You know what it's like to have gold raining out of your hands? That'll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig. I'm just sorry about Wes. He was all right. It was the gold that made him what he became. If I hadn't found that map, if I hadn't talked them into going searching...Wes just might have made it home after all. I guess I feel responsible for him.
Yeah, well, I've been thinking about that. See, there was an explosion and everything, but I never really aaw Epps get killed. And nobody ever found the gold. I guess they both could have been burned to slag. I guess. But there were a lot of bodies out on that road. A smart man could have found some identification to use. A smart man could have made his way up to Syria or Turkey. A smart man could have gotten himself right out of the Middle East. A smart man with enough gold. Way I figure, right about now old Epps is sitting in a bar in Sydney, or Melboure, or maybe Brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest Aussies you ever saw.
Well, Sir, I guess you don't know Second Lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?

We're online for exactly two minutes.
Slow down.
Gotcha.
Nobody knows you're here. Not your people. Not even my President. You'll die here alone and be buried unknown -- barring some miracle.
-- God? GOD? What you eat. Whether you eat. Sleep. Pain. Absence of pain. I decide. I make the day and the night. Even the way you got here -- a hand that reached down from the sky? God? I am your new God.
Brooklyn South issued a code blue less than two minutes ago. They think hostages are involved.
Black-and-whites on the scene?
Setting up a perimeter now.
Residence or business?
A bus.
They have been joined by Anthony Hubbard, the ASAC.
SWAT?
On the way.
Negotiator?
Rolling.
Bomb squad?
How soon can we get there --?
In this traffic, maybe tomorrow.
Oh, fuck. It just blew.
-- What?!
-- That's what they're telling me.
-- And nobody's hurt?
Thank God.
Demand for what? You hear any demand?
You sure this is all they got?
Maybe it's performance art.
-- Okay. Blue paint. Voice-altering technology --
-- available from The Sharper Image catalogue.
Still, the rhetoric sounds political. Militia?
Not their style.
Frank --?
Jihad isn't known for their sense of humor, and Hamas is raising so much money here, why queer their deal?
Anyway, isn't Green the color of Islam, not blue?
-- And, excuse me, but why do we immediately assume they're Arabs?
I want a composite of the suspects in circulation by the end of business today. Tina, you cross-check it against the mainframe. Mike, have you got the lab analysis on the paint?
Not yet...
-- See if any was sold in quantity the last month. Danny --
-- find out what stop these guys got on the bus, maybe there's a witness.
Hub... I think we're all eager to give up our weekends on this. It just occurs to me, has anybody even committed a crime here? I mean, assault with a deadly color?
Here's what I don't like. They know explosives. They know our response time. They put in a call and walk.
Excuse me, sir. I think you should see this. Came in on the Fax.
Release him? Him who? Who are we holding?
Marv Albert?
-- Omar Abdel Rahman... asshole.
The Hamas guy got released in April.
Under protest.
Why be coy about it?
Hub, somebody's flashing a government badge over at the warehouse where they're working on the bus. Our tech guys want to know if we're cooperating with any other agencies on this thing.
-- Agency?
Hi.
Special Agent Anthony Hubbard. FBI.
-- And you've been trying to "liaise" with me all day? Did you think of trying the phone book, Elise? We have fourteen lines, that's not counting the unlisted ones.
Hi, I'm Elise Kraft, National Security Council.
And I'm Colin Powell. What exactly do you people want with my bus.
We're all on the same team here, Agent Hubbard.
Who exactly is "we" on this particular team, Elise?
It's never the question that's indiscreet, only the answer.
Tell you what, you send me an official inter-agency request for cooperation on this and I'll give you copies of everything we come up with. Otherwise, get your ass on out of here before you contaminate my crime scene any more than you already have.
There's no reason to be nasty.
You think this is nasty? In case you haven't heard. The CIA has no charter to operate domestically. Which puts you in violation of federal law.
Not according to the Cooperation Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- I suggest you reread the paragraph on sharing information. I happen to be well within my authority.
Special Order 12333 refers to domestic terrorism. You got something you want to "share" with me? Us being teammates and all?
Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon as I do, I'll --
-- get back to me, yeah, I know. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna have a couple my "teammates" here escort you back to wherever you came from. And then I'm gonna go back to the office and wait for that official cooperation request. Okay by you?
Swell.
Nice meeting you, Elise. Is that Elise with an "E" or an "A"?
Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent Hubbard.
Tail her.
...Nice, wasn't it?
Very.
You ever gonna stop by, pick up your things?
-- He doing her?
Some detective you are. They stopped.
Really? I wonder if she likes white guys.
I wonder if she likes bald guys.
You must be so proud...
-- big orthodontia bills. Someday, you'll understand.
Where we going?
You're staying with your family. I'm back in the morning.
You sleep here? Immigration called.
-- who's trying to score points with his boss, bigtime.
Has he broken any laws?
Not anymore.
...He means, "dowry."
Check out his neck.
The tabac. Sssssss... The territories.
Put him in play.
-- on the Van Wyck... No, not yet. -- What are we in?
A '97 Contour. On my Visa. Back home, the security services'd be up this guy's ass with a poker, but what do we do, we let him go.
...Six teams on the ground, at least... well, pull 'em off the UN... Stay back...
Not my first date, Hub. He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's Brooklyn.
I want husbands and wives, I want baby carriages, and no Brooks Brothers.
You're micro-managing.
-- And find me a judge I can work with. We want sound on this guy... damn'... I'm losing you... And bring us a radio.
I get reimbursed for this, right?
Twelve bucks in Gaza.
America's the place to be if you're a terrorist. Fred's hovering. Patsy, take over...
...Tell her to watch out for reflections.
I got the Judge.
...Good morning, Sir. How're things in the Second Circuit this morning...? ...I hear you... Listen, Judge, we're in a kind of situation here...
Hold on, will ya, Judge? Is he talking to somebody, who's he talking to? Are we getting film?
-- Frank?
Don't know him. If we were allowed to get sound on them, we'd know him.
...What's that? No, Judge, not yet we're not... but we have reason to believe he may be involved with -- Damnit Tommy! He's overacting! Tell him -- Sorry, Judge... No... I just --
He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's --
Go, go, go!!! All units --
Christ!
Judge, I'm gonna have to call you back...
Shit --! I didn't take the insurance.
What the --?
They just found the van. Doesn't look like they're gonna find any prints.
Run him down, bring him in.
Floyd Rose.
Go, Floyd.
I had a dog like that once.
It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're spies.
The dog works for the CIA?
All units report in turn.
Let's roll.
Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill.
Ralph, spare us.
I never touched him.
Really? I'm taking him into custody just the same.
What are you going to charge him with? Jaywalking? I don't suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first?
Not in this lifetime.
You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? If you guys hadn't blown the surveillance, we'd have been able to follow the money. What do you think, Khalil, you would have led us right to your friends, wouldn't you?
What friends --? What have you got for me, Elise?... Enlighten me. Tell me now or tell me downtown.
Get this guy out of here and book him.
One phone call and he's mine again. You know the number. I have --
You have "the right to remain silent," you have "the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law -- "
Oh, come on... Do you have any idea what you're starting here, the kind of shitstorm you're about to --
-- Kidnapping. Obstruction of Justice. Assault.
Cuff her.
So, Elise... You okay back there, you don't get carsick or anything? Those handcuffs too tight --?
Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or Sunni?
Wow. You're really good. She's really good.
You ready to tell us what's going on here, Elise --? Was the paintbomb a warning?
American University of Beirut? I was there from '79 to 82.
No shit?
My father taught Economics. Henry Kraft?
Is there a terrorist cell operating in this city that we are unaware of?
Such a tragedy. Growing up in that city was... paradise. Like an exotic Paris, wasn't it, Frank --?
You ever been in Rikers, Elise? You know what happens in there?
...Yum.
Any communication at all?
Get the frequency of the driver's radio and patch it through to this number. We need two lines. Frank, get a negotiator out here.
That gives us something to work with.
What's happening out there...
They've taken another bus, haven't they? Talk to me...
Oh, now you want to talk. You want to be my friend, is that it?
Listen, these guys are the real deal.
How do you know?
Is there a terrorist cell operating in Brooklyn?
Yes.
Was the blue paint a warning?
Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll blow the bus.
If they wanted to blow the bus then why haven't they blown the bus --?
I... don't know.
Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can help.
The driver's name is Larry Kaiser. He says they've got explosives strapped to their chests, they got automatic weapons, and they're speaking Arabic.
Where the hell's the negotiator?
Tunnel's got twenty minute delays and they're working on both bridges.
What else did he say about the device? Did he describe it at all? Anything about a button, or a cord, or...
Oh, God.
...They're not here to negotiate.
Meaning?
They were waiting for the cameras.
-- Hub...
They're want the newsies here. They want everybody watching.
You've got the shooters in place?
-- So?
Use 'em.
What?
Kill 'em now.
It's lose-lose any way you play it... Do you want to lose little or lose big?
We have rules of engagement we're gonna follow here, folks, so put the safeties back on your weapons. Nobody's killing anybody until we see what's what.
Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the FBI, I'll be negotiating our way out of this. Let me talk to one of them... I know... I know. You just hang in there, Larry... No, don't worry, I've got somebody here who can translate.
Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard. I don't have any authority to make deals, or respond to demands. I just want to find out if you need anything in there? If any of the passengers are in need of medical attention?
-- Frank?
I don't know if they understand.
Sir, is there anything you want to say to me? That I can tell my people here?
The guy's just breathing into the phone, maybe they're not even Arabs.
I get the feeling you don't want to talk, but will you listen --? ...Whatever grievance you have, whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't involve these children --
So I'm gonna ask you to... please... let... the... children go.
Okay, here we go...
Thank you, sir. I appreciate that gesture, I really do. The best way to get what you want in these situations is to show yourself to be reasonable. As you've just done. Now we've got some more to talk about...
I am unarmed, as you can see. So I propose... You let the rest of the passengers go, and I take their place... That way, there's no pizza deliveries or bathroom breaks to worry about -- and all these -- -- people... will disappear.
I'm gonna take your silence to mean you're considering my offer --
How about we just start with a few of the elderly people you got on there. It's got to be hard for the older folks to be standing all this time.
Thank you, sir. Now let's just let these --
Fights for consciousness.
I'm... alright. I'm --
-- okay... Just let me --
Is anybody --
-- every trap, every hole. I want to rumble every mosque, every community center, every student organization that's ever said an unkind word. I want the heat turned up under all our assets, all our informers, every snitch gets twisted inside out. And put some money out on the street -- Arab community hates these people as much as we do. They'll help. Have you got positive ID on --
Hub, we don't have positive ID on anybody.
We need more hands. Fred --
I'm on it.
I want to talk to Khalil.
He's down the hall.
-- Conferences with DC at 9:00, 12:00, 4:00 and 9:00. Call your families, find a sleeping bag, nobody leaves this office until we have a strand to pull. Oklahoma City, people. The first twenty-four hours are the only twenty-four hours.. And I don't want to see anybody walking.
Doctor seen him?
He's on his way up.
Got a cigarette --?
You don't smoke.
Ten thousand dollars.
Khalil. I want to talk about the money.
Okay...
Doesn't like second hand smoke.
You ready to talk about money?
...He says he loves America and only wanted to get away from the security services at home.
...He says he's sorry but he didn't know he was doing something bad. His cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase to an address in Brooklyn. He's a cut-out.
Nasty habit. 3830 Flatbush Avenue.
We want every rental agreement from every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels, motels, flophouses... It's cash, guys. They're the only ones in America using cash.
-- ask it if they've ever hit buses?
-- with a Q-tip. Bone shards, hair, fingernails --
-- He's way over his head.
Shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket.
Ladies and Gentlemen, meet the late Ali Waziri.
Tina talked to the Israelis and traced this sucker to a group operating out of Ramallah. That's the West Bank, not the West Side for those of you just joining us from Nebraska.
Okay, we've pulled his landing card and his I-94. So now we know he came in three days ago, out of Frankfurt --
What we need now is to fill in the time between his arrival and the incident. All known associations, and most of all, we need an address.
IAP66. What's IAP66?
Hold on, hold on, I'm looking it up --
-- Today, Danny...
Wait, wait -- Here we go. Student Visa, J-1.
Where's the original --?
In his passport.
Which is... vaporized.
Where's the copy?
At the point of issuance. Could be the American Consulate in Tel Aviv. The American Consulate in Amman, Cairo, Alexandria, Riyadh -- all an easy drive from the West Bank --
What time is it --?
Three-fifteen. P.M. When's the last time you ate?
Sir. They want you in the lab.
You're saying they're Egyptian?
-- It's what they use for funerals. The guy was wearing a shroud.
Let's see if she's ready to talk.
I thought one phone call and you were out of here.
I didn't make the call.
Why not?
Are you alright --?
Just some tinnitus in my left ear --
I need to know what I don't know.
Life's too short.
You hungry?
We ordering in --?
-- The funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification. First a fast, then --
-- the washing of the body, then the shroud. I saw it on Sixty Minutes. Tell me something I don't know.
...Last March in Iraq, we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year. In August, he went to Lebanon. Where he was... extracted.
Extracted? Extracted by whom? I see.
His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal. He's Iraqi. And something of a religious leader.
With something of a devoted following? ...Okay, I can understand why we might not want to publicize the fact that our government's in the kidnapping business, but why not tell us?
He's still being... debriefed. They're not ready to go public with charges.
What else you got on his followers.
Clearly, they're committed.
Meaning?
In this game, the most committed wins.
So they'll just keep coming until we release him.
Unless we match their commitment with our own.
What about talking to this sheik?
You don't think they've got guys talking to the sheik? Except the sheik isn't talking.
So who's giving the orders? How do they coordinate, pick their targets?
Believe me, we've put every resource we've got onto that very question. Otherwise... we wait.
We wait.
If there's anybody on earth who knows how you feel, it's me. But you've got to let it go. Those people were dead the minute they got on the bus.
Sorry, boss. Hello, Elise. Mmmm, is that pastrami? Oh, yeah, we made the guy in the picture.
My people. The last of the unambivalent smokers. Monsters. The toughest motherfucker in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to some of these guys.
His name's Samir Nazhde. Teaches Arab Studies at Brooklyn College. He sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa. And dig this -- his brother blew up a movie theatre in Tel Aviv.
You might consider leaving him alone.
Why would I consider doing that --?
Play him like a cop and haul him in now and get your arrest, or tag him and let him lead you to the really big fish.
You're fishing and he's getting visas for bombers.
You ever heard of catch and release?
Yes, and he's on the next plane for Tunis.
Take him down.
Go.
Samir Nazhde, my name is Frank Haddad, I'm a Federal Agent. We have reason to believe you are an accessory to the bombing of Bus 87.
Are you crazy --?
You are an associate of Ali Waziri.
Who? I know no one by that name.
You got him a student visa.
I sign these applications as a matter of course, hundreds of them. Everyone wants to come to the land of opportunity and Baywatch.
You spent two years in Israeli jails during the Intifada.
The only ones who didn't were women like you.
Frank --
Sorry. Family matter. You're going downtown, my friend.
You cannot hold me. I know my rights. I watch American television.
Defrauding the INS is a Federal Offense. Reservation for one, please.
Club Fed.
"Oh, Danny-boy, the perps, the perps, are call-ing... We need a search warrant on Samir...
Frank, c'mere a sec. I want to show you something.
Frank, you ever hit a prisoner again I'll have your badge.
-- Someday I will tell you what those people did to my village in '71.
Okay. But right now, act as if I'm capable of saying something funny... Now, let's go see about that warrant.
Find me a Judge who'll play ball this time. And set up a polygraph for Samir.
I still don't understand why we're tipping our hand with him --
What's there to tip?
You're just trying to protect your asset. Aren't you, Elise --? He's your Joe, your asset. He's working for you, you're his case officer -- right?
...Sometimes... in addition to being a nationality, being a Palestinian is also a... profession. A lucrative one.
Meaning, he's your Joe.
Mine. Yours. The Israelis. The Saudis. At one time or another, everybody in the Middle East has slept with everybody else.
So you're saying... you sleep around?
Only professionally.
So we share him.
No.
-- Call INS, find out his status and start deportation proceedings.
I can't let you do that.
Oh, you can't let me do that. What precisely is your involvement with these people.
Samir's been a very important... project of mine for some time... I'm the only one he'll deal with. He's very well-connected -- and extremely high-strung.
...Call the judge.
How easy is it to get inside, Frank? How good are your sources in the mosques? How many people you got in Hamas --?
No surveillance. I've seen your deft touch.
Daily reports. We tap his phone.
And I get to see the transcripts.
Fair enough.
And I run him.
We share him.
He can't know we're talking.
Then don't tell him.
Done.
Let him fly. But we better start seeing product.
Any more surprises for me?
Not tonight.
Then I'm going home to get some things.
I'll have somebody drive you.
I'll grab a cab.
Elise. I'm really high strung, too.
You let him HIT ME --!! You cannot care about me and let such things happen!
Next time don't be such a smart ass --
Sometimes I hate you just because you are so American. It makes me want to hurt you. I think about fucking you and hurting you.
-- You want to fuck me? Then work with me.
Don't tell me what I have to do.
No? Do we really want to have this conversation again? Do we --?
I need you to help me. I need you to be strong. As you have always been strong. For both of us. -- Samir? Look at me...
-- Some people just cannot live in the camps. For my brother, it was already like dying. The only thing he lives for is movies.
-- And then some sheik tells him that, to die for Allah is beautiful. If he does this thing, our parents will be taken care of, and he will live on in Paradise with seventy virgins. Seventy. And my brother, he needs to believe it very much, so he straps ten sticks of dynamite to his chest and goes to the movies... And I become a VIP. It is very confusing.
-- So who are you afraid of betraying? You know these people. They bomb, they maim. Do they represent the Palestine you want to build? They're using you.
You are using me, too! Everybody uses the Palestinians! We are the whores of the Middle East! You make reports about our little talks --? What about fucking me?
I had to get special permission for that.
Beats cable.
Hi. I understand they call you Hub.
I know who you are, General.
Bill Devereaux.
I served in the --
82nd Airborne, I know. Same time I was running the --
-- 173rd. Put me through school.
God. Duty. Honor. Country. Where on Capitol Hill, Wall Street, or Hollywood would you find one man who's even paused over one of those words in the last ten years?
What, uh, brings you here, General?... Can I get you some coffee?
You want me to get to the point. The President's concerned. He's worried that -- have you met him by any chance?
No, sir, I haven't. I know -- reading the papers -- terrorism's a real concern for him. And your job is to --
-- With all the affection for the man I can tell you he doesn't know fuckall about terrorism, or the Mideast, that I don't put on his cue cards. What he's expert in is his own survival. You get my meaning?
I didn't guess you came all this way for a cup of coffee.
Agent Hubbard -- you look like you think I'm here to take your baby away!
With all respect for your expertise, sir. We're on track here.
Which is what I said to the President -- the Army is not some big green police department. Stick with the man on the ground.
I appreciate your support.
You're sure you're not chasing your own tail, though?
What do you know about Sheik Ahmed Bin Talal?
Old news.
Maybe not. We've received two communications -- from the bombers to "Release Him."
We can't release him.
I know our stated policy is not to negotiate with terrorists, but --
Hub, we can't release him because we don't have him. We never had him. And besides that, he's dead.
The CIA says --
The CIA? The CIA couldn't predict the fall of the Berlin Wall until bricks were hitting them in the head. The Libyans snatched the Sheik -- some sectarian Muslim thing -- I'll explain it next time you have a free week. They killed him. Qaddafi put out disinformation that it was us... Who was your source on this?
Elise Kraft.
...A woman will never know the Middle East. You're talking about a culture that keeps its women slipcovered. Elise Kraft can't tell a Sheik from the prophylactic of the same name.
I appreciate the heads up.
Hub, we've got Judge Frankel in -- Oh. Hello, General.
Please, don't let me --
Sorry. That tip on the landlord looks solid. The judge will see us right away.
Sounds like I should get out of your way. We're there if you need us. Your father well, Elise?
As can be expected. How's Maggie?
Top of her game. Well, go get 'em.
Making new friends.
How's your lip --?
So... you like to watch --?
No. Just learning about commitment.
It's a full contact sport.
-- You're telling me that just because some Brooklyn landlord tips you off that he's been paid in cash, you have the right to call in the cavalry -- ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash is not yet a crime in this country.
You're not hearing me. This Khalil was carrying cash for --
-- You've observed him giving cash to --
... No, but --
-- But you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus 87 --?
I know we'll turn up trace elements of semtex, chemicals... something.
And when you do, you'll get your warrant.
What about as a feasibility study?
Meaning?
We enter first, take a look, then fill out the warrant.
Tell me the difference between that and breaking-and-entering?
We're the good guys.
Not good enough.
What is good enough, Judge? Another bus? A school, maybe. These things come in waves.
Waves mean nothing to me; there's been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years, but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure I'd send you packing. There's a price to be paid for living in a free society --
-- and not in cash I guarantee it.
-- Not two Judges from now, not two HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from now. These guys could split any SECOND and you've lost your best shot at --
Frank's working another warrant --
You don't understand, they're pros! From the age of twelve they've been dodging people like you, people better than you.
You mean people like you?
-- no matter how sparkling your record is, no matter how terrified you are to fail --
It's... against... the... law.
-- Just because you went to night school, or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn't make you Sir Thomas More.
Just because you talk the talk doesn't make you an expert. And just because you read my file doesn't make you an expert on me.
You're gonna lose them and they're gonna do another horrible --
-- You think I want to lose them. Where do you get off talking that shit. If I don't take 'em down properly they'll be on the street two hours from now. I could find dynamite, semtex, plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless I've got the right warrant it's all inadmissible
They've also got a warrant. A warrant from God. They're ready to die! And your quaint laws don't mean shit to these people.
My quaint laws? Last I checked you were an American citizen. And these happen to be the only laws we got. Look, I'm just a cop, okay, and I'm real sorry the cold war's over, and you Masters of the Universe got nothing going on over there in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever -- but you're just not in the Middle East anymore...
Oh, really...?
They're discussing how hard it is to find a decent cup of coffee over here. I make out three voices. What do you have on the infrared?
Three sounds right. If we had microwave we'd know for sure. The CIA's got microwave, how come we don't have microwave.
You want change, right --?
You gonna open the door, or what --?
Jesus, didn't ya hear crime's down seven-percent...
Drop your weapon!
What about the others? See if we can get a pulse --
Terminal.
Same here.
Gone.
We got semtex, we got detcord, same stuff as the bus, the whole enchilada...
Anybody like anchovies --?
Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT.
What --?
It didn't fire. They had it rigged to the door and it didn't fire.
We're too old to be lucky, Frank.
My first boyfriend was Palestinian. My father liked to say, they seduce you with their suffering.
You ever been over there --? ...The courtesy with which they welcome you into their homes. And the people, these incredibly... warm people in this... austere land.
But you work against them.
Only the crazies. I tend to be suspicious of all true believers. Present company included.
So I'm a fanatic.
Let's just say you don't seem the ambivalent type.
Is that right?
So why're are you a fed?
That's what my nephew keeps asking me. "Why you with The Man, Unc?"
...Well? What'd you tell him?
You read my file. You tell me.
Let's see... Catholic school. Captain of this, president of that. Hard work, fair play, make a difference, change the system from within. Rah. Rah. Rah.
That was in my file?
...Tell me I'm wrong.
...What --?
You believe in anything, Elise --?
Like what, for instance?
How about right and wrong?
It's easy to choose between right and wrong. What's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right. I just want to make it all... a little... better. Ignore me. I'm shitfaced.
So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us about being a spook? Ever meet Aldrich Ames? Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs?
You were in charge of Waco, right -- ? Or was that Ruby Ridge?
The Shah of Iran, Noriega, I love the way you guys predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar Hoover wore a dress.
What do you say, Hub...? Peace?
This feels like high school.
-- only my prom date wasn't packing a gun.
Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours?
Two inches. From the ground. So what's the latest from Samir. I want a list of every visa he sponsored.
Not sure he'll do it.
I once knew this undercover guy, started to care so much about his source --
-- Samir's a source. Period.
Have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side?
Samir in bed with them? That would too much to wish for.
You're so confident.
Only in bed.
Whoa... What do they put in these drinks --?
They got earthquakes in Manhattan?
I don't know.
Sounds great, General, except why can't we find out who's behind it -- ?
How about who's behind who's behind this?
Ask a question. Get an atlas.
All I know is that we must respond.
Respond, sure. But how?
Find out who it is and bomb the shit out of them.
And if we can't find out --?
Look it keeps escalating. First a bus, then the theatre. What's next?
Anything but leadership.
With all respect, Senator, why don't we just stipulate that the President is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business.
What about sending in the Guard?
The Army then. I've seen the contingency plans.
Even if that's what our own people are asking for, three to one?
President Lincoln declared martial law in 1862. He suspended --
And I've got an election in November. Ex-United States Congressman.
Guys, guys, the President lost a lot of friends last night --
Not to mention six points in the polls.
-- And his plane lands in two hours. We owe it to him to have a consensus.
...General?
The Army is a broadsword not a scalpel. You do not want us in an American city.
But hypothetically... how long would it take you to --
We only go if the President invokes the War Powers Act.
I understand that, General. Let us imagine, though, for a moment, that the order has been given.
...Twelve hours after the President gives the word we can be on the ground. One light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men. Elements of the Rapid Deployment Force combined with Special Forces -- Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters. And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or Seven- Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a VFW parade.

That means civilian casualties. At a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a Hummer who runs down an old lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum... Make no mistake. We will hunt the enemy. We will find the enemy. And we will kill the enemy.

And no card-carrying member of the ACLU is more deadset against it... than I am. Which is why I urge you... no, I implore you not to consider this option.
I know what the President will say.
What's that?
That's exactly why you're the only man for the job.
The Army General speaks up.
-- Could I interrupt?
That's Anthony Hubbard, FBI. He's the ASAC on the ground up there. They took out the first cell less than 36 hours after bus 87. I suggest we hear what he has to say --
There is something you probably haven't thought about doing?
And that is --?
Nothing. Don't over-react. With all respect, gentlemen, I'm just a cop. To you these people may be martyrs, but to me they're criminals. And a criminal is no more than somebody who thinks he's better than everyone else. And he's not better. He only has to be wrong once. And that's where we come in. We run down a tip from a landlord, or we pick up a latent print from a bus. Our phones are ringing off the hook with people from the Arab community wanting to help.
They love this country and they hate that these criminals are giving them a bad name. With their help and some old-fashioned shoe leather, we'll nail these guys.
-- Amen to that.
Thank you, Agent Hubbard. I, too, think we should proceed cautiously. Now we've got an Agency briefing prepared... Some of you may not know Sharon Bridger. Sharon was posted in Iraq as part of our covert operations during the Gulf War. -- Sharon...
We all know the traditional model of a terrorist network. One cell controlling all others. Cut off the head and the body will wither.
Unfortunately the old wisdom no longer applies. The new paradigm is like the myth of the Hydra. Each cell exists independent of the other. Cut off one head and another rises up in its place.

Bus 87 was the work of Cell #1. Its elimination only activated the work of Cell #2 -- the theatre gala.

And Cell #3? How do we find Cell #3?
Close on Sharon/Elise. As time elongates. She knows.
We don't know.
-- Are they confirmed?
Fred, Whitney, we're waiting on who else...
Sharon.
This is Colonel Hardwick. Army Intelligence.
Anthony Hubbard. Average intelligence. But 'til I hear otherwise this is still my show.
I'm here as an advisor only. I intend to keep a low profile.
I appreciate that, Colonel.
I don't mean to be insensitive, but what, exactly, are your capabilities at this point? Your... infrastructure --
You're standing on our infrastructure. Excuse me.
-- Brooklyn.
Fiber thinks they've come up with a piece of the shroud. Egyptian cotton.
We just got a confirmation on Mike. He was with Fred in the lobby.
How many does that make it --?
I'm... very sorry... about your friends.
Frank. This is Sharon. -- I didn't catch the last name.
...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank?
Been better.
The agency has come up with another list of probables.
I think we should circulate them. Hey, this stuff may be good.
Why was there no warning from Samir?
Because he didn't know anything.
Says Samir.
Says me.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Over my dead body.
Over six hundred dead bodies.
Look, he's one of the good guys. Okay?
How the fuck can you be so sure?
Because he helped me recruit the network in Iraq. OKAY?
We were part of the operation to destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing up fake dinars, arming the Kurds --
-- and financing the Sheik.
He's Iraqi. He was going to be our Ayatollah Khomeini --
-- And help bring down Saddam.
I ran the network. Samir was the go- between. He risked his life for us over there.
So who are they? Give me names, Give me pictures. Not some history lesson.
I can't give you pictures because I don't know what they look like. We did everything at arm's length.
So you got nothing.
I've got Samir.
Has he had any contact with them?
Minimal.
How does he do it?
He can't. They initiate.
And otherwise...
He's waiting.
He's waiting? What's he waiting for? More bodies? We got lots more buildings in midtown, maybe he's waiting to see how many they can blow up.
Look, I know how you must feel --

They'll make contact soon.
How?... Why soon?
What's the tradecraft, Sharon? Ironsites, visuals? I love all that spy shit. I'm gonna haul your boy downtown, strap his ass to a polygraph and ask him all about you. Then I'm gonna send the transcripts to a friend of mine at the Times who just loves to write about the latest CIA link to some political horror show.
You burn him, you lose any chance you ever had.
It's lose-lose from here on in, who said that?
I'm not fucking with you.
How can you possibly remember who you're fucking?
I need... more time. Please. You're hurting me. Please...
That's good sound.
Except they're not saying anything worth listening to.
One's his uncle, he owns the place. The other's a doctor. They check out clean.
He go there every day?
A clean body and a pure heart.
-- If you're on the State Department Terrorist Watch list you cannot get into this country. But Ali Waziri was on the watch list, and he got in.
Did you call the State Department?
They told me to call INS.
-- And?
They told me to call State.
Don't you just love government?
-- THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING --!
My department WHAT, ASSHOLE...?
Sorry. From now on, we will raise our hands and wait to be called on --
Danny --?
We bring 'me in, have a talk.
Where the hell we gonna put sixteen hundred people?
I don't think we're there yet. It's also not going to stop these people.
Thank you, sir. And to everyone else for their patience today. These are extremely difficult times -- London, Paris, we're not the first city to have to deal with this.
In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew up the market, the market was full. This is New York. We can take it.
-- one of the moms was carrying a piece, wounds the guy as he's planting the device. He kills her and locks them all in. Up there in the corner... by the clock.
-- It's got a timer on it only we don't know how much time is left.
Closer on the timer.
What the fuck is the NYPD doing here?!
I don't know. Somebody must have --

I KNOW --! YOU THINK I --
QUIT BICKERING AND FIX IT!
NYPD SWAT, this is the FBI. Get that bird the fuck out of there!
Who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more, is also weeping now. Weeping for the victims of the bombings, weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself.
This just came in.
You alright?
My neck's a little stiff, that's all.
That's not what I meant.
I know.
You want a drink?
Sure.
That was a pretty crazy thing you did today.
Better days.
I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel like... being alone... tonight.
Where's Samir?
I could call him. Maybe he'd join us.
You'd like that.
I might. Or I could call Tina.

Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but I did what I had to do. You know as well as I do, running an agent can be very... complicated.
How about running an FBI agent?
You think I'm trying to run you?
...Why else are you here?
...You know why I'm here.
Tell me to leave.
Leave.
No.
The FBI received another fax.
Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under the impression that we have him.
Do we? Have him?
To refresh your memory, as I told you last time, it was the Libyans who --
I remember perfectly well what you said last time. Do we?
Let me give you some free advice, son. Don't get between me and the President. You might break a nail.
I am speaking for the President.
As far as the President is concerned... No, we do not.
General, do you know that after yesterday's attack, half the parents in this country kept their children out of school --? ...They're attacking our way of life. It's got to stop. And the President cannot afford to be weak.
Are you saying the President is prepared to take the necessary steps...?
I'm saying, the President is prepared to be... Presidential.
Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down, slow down --
Today, with the invocation of the War Powers Act by the President, I am declaring a state of martial law in this city.
To the best of our knowledge, we are opposed by no more than twenty of the enemy. He is hiding among a population of roughly two million.
Intelligence tells us he is most likely Arab-speaking, between the age of fourteen and thirty. Narrowing the target to fifteen thousand suspects.
We can further reduce that number down to those who have been in this country less than six months. Now you have twenty hiding among two thousand.
If you are one of these twenty young men, you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background. Unfortunately for you, you can only hide there. And that population, in the classic immigration pattern, is concentrated. Right here in Brooklyn.
We intend to seal off this borough. And then we intend to squeeze it. This is the land of opportunity, gentlemen. The opportunity to turn yourselves in. After sundown tonight any young man fitting the profile I described who has not cooperated will be arrested and detained.
There is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of an army than policing its own citizens.
But the enemy would be sadly mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve. They are now face to face with the most fearsome killing machine in the history of man. And I intend to use it. And be back on base in time for the play-offs... That is all.
Hub. Good to see you again.
I can't say the same, sir. Not in that uniform. I thought you were against this.
I am against it. It wasn't my call.
"I'm only following orders" didn't work at Nuremberg. It may not be your policy but they're your tactics.
Your operation had its chance, Hub, and you couldn't get it done. You're down three touchdowns. Time to bring in the first string.
Against our own team?
Are you questioning my patriotism?
I'm questioning your judgement, yes, sir.
Hub, I want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier. I have a dozen tropical diseases I'll never entirely get rid of. I set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass. I have watched men die and I have killed. Now I am serving my President and quite possibly not the best interests of my country, but my profession doesn't afford me the luxury of that distinction. I won't question your patriotism but don't you ever again question my command.
I'm not under your command, General.
Take a good look around, my friend, and tell me that's still true. But we're not shutting you out. In fact, I can't do it without you, Hub. I need men like you. Men willing to put it on the line like you did in that schoolroom. These stars mean I have been putting it on the line for thirty years... and never made a mistake worth remembering. Don't tell me I made a mistake about you.
They're not shutting us out. They need men like me.
He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick. You ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice?
We're putting Samir in play.
Now? With all this going on? He's freaked.
Oh, right, he's high-strung. Only you can manage him. You and the CIA and the DIA and God-knows-who-else you're really working for --! Get back in there, Sharon, Elise, whatever the fuck your name is -- They'll probably make you a Colonel... if you're not one already.
All this... is no more in our interest than it is in yours, Hub.
What, exactly, are your interests, Sharon? You protect Samir, you protect the agency. You're interested in protecting everything but your country.
You have no idea what I do for my country.
No, and I don't want to know. With you or without you we're putting Samir in play. Now.
One more lamb to the slaughter.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God...
Does he understand the difference between the FBI and the DEA?
Samir... It's fine, he's cool.
Listen to that --! Are you listening? They're killing Arabs out there!
You can stop it all right now.
What are you talking about --? The army is here. They're setting up interrogation centers right now. They're torturing people in cellars.
Let's just calm down for a second...
-- I've got to get out of here. You have to help me --
We'll take care of you... don't worry. You just have to calm down --
Money... I must have more money...
-- You got a student visa for Ali Waziri. Because... somebody asked you to -- Didn't they --?
I... got it myself.
Liar --!
You... tell him... what he wants to know.
Hey, that's enough.
He knows. He fucking knows.
She's crazy. They're ghosts. Jinn. They'd never trust someone like me.
Stop simpering.
Please...
I've got a picture of the two of us, do you remember that picture, Samir? I'm going to post that picture in every mosque in Brooklyn. And then I'm gonna send copies to some friends of mine on the West Bank. You've got family there, don't you --?
Let go of me --
Now... Nobody's going to burn you, nobody's going to call anybody -- -- Who asked you to get that visa?
Don't be afraid. I can protect you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I'm afraid of going to hell.
His name is Tariq Husseini. He runs an auto shop. ...on Commerce Street in Red Hook.
My beeper number. Anybody messes with you, I'm there in twenty minutes.
You're good.
You're not so bad yourself.
In a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest microwave technology , he has OVERHEARD the entire conversation.
You calling Devereaux.
Didn't get his number. Darn. Floyd, Hub. We need to put something together in a big-ass hurry... Where's Frank --?... Give him a 911.
-- and find some kind of beat-up car... Well, beat it up yourself if you have to... 896 Commerce St... it's a garage in Red Hook... but remember -- -- they're pros.
Jesus...
Tariq will go to ground.
We can hit him in less than an hour.
Hit him hard.
Where are you going?
I've got to stash Samir someplace safe. Go with God.
FBI --! FBI --!
Now... I'm gonna... reach... into my jacket... and show you... my shield.
All Units, report in turn. If talking will reveal your position, just key your walkie...
Yo...
Tariq around?
Tariq?
How can I help you.
You're Tariq Husseini?
He's out.
Damn. Do you think you could give him a message?
Of course.
Tell him the FBI is after him.
You're joking.
Very... slowly... put your hands on top of the table.
That wouldn't be a racist epithet, now would it? Stand up.
Where are the others?
What others?
Do as he says.
Code blue.
Code Red.
Crawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as:
1942, my father was put into the camps at Manzanar. Until the end of the war. Two years. Now he roots for the Dodgers and swears it could never happen again.
They got Frankie. My kid's here someplace --
Frank, slow down --
He's only thirteen, for Chrissake --
I'll get him out.
They came into my house. My wife told them who I was -- How many times did I put it on the line, Hub --? How many times --
Frank --
We're American citizens, twenty years. Ten years in the bureau -- They knocked her down... and took him. Out of my own house.
It's wrong, Frank. What can I say to you, but it's... all... terribly... horribly... wrong. Now, come with me.
NO! I've got to find him. Besides, this is where I belong. Here. I'm not their sand nigger anymore.
-- And his name is Haddad?
Frank... Haddad. Junior.
His father's a Shiite. We're checking him out.
Check this out, pal. His father's a federal agent for ten years.
Don't get in my face, Hubbard. I might decide you're an Ethiopian.
And you're just stupid enough to think that's an insult.
If a mistake's been made we'll fix it.
There is no "if". I'm vouching for this kid. I want him out.
And I said we will look into it.
You mean, like you're looking into me? Surveilling me? Breaking up my operations? If I'd known I was going to have to do your job for you I would never have left the army.
There's an FBI office in Anchorage, Agent Hubbard. Fuck with me and you'll be learning a hundred and fifty new words for snow.
Tariq Husseini is my prisoner. I want to see him.
The prisoner is being interrogated.
I want to see him.
How long have you been at it?
Not long enough, apparently.
How much longer, do you think, before he gives up the other cells --
He can't give up the other cells if he doesn't know about them.
He knows.
What about her briefing? The strategy session -- she said the cells don't know about each other, that they --
How long before he breaks?
At this rate. Too long. The theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell.
So -- what other models do we have -- ?
Shaking.
What about it, Sharon?
-- Won't work.
Works for the Israelis.
Only in conjunction with sleep deprivation. Needs at least thirty- six hours.
We don't have thirty-six hours.
Electric shock?
The neurotransmitters just shut down.
Water?
Palestinian authority is producing good intel using water.
Are you people insane --?
The time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds
How about two men? How about three? How about public executions, that might work.
You're welcome to wait outside.
General... you've lost men, I've lost men... but what you're doing... It doesn't work in Belfast. It doesn't work in Gaza. And it won't work here. -- What if... they don't want their leader back at all? You said yourself, we don't even have him. Maybe what they really want -- is that we herd our children into stadiums. Put soldiers into our streets. Radicalize people who want to think of themselves as Americans. Bend the law, shred the constitution. Because if we torture him -- and let's call it what it is... You... and I... then the country men like us have sworn to defend. And bled to defend. And died to defend... is gone. And they've won.
I think we have to soundproof the room before we begin.
Escort him out.
Let's get this over with.
He knew nothing.
C'mon in, we're still trying to get the last one down.
...The President wants this shit over with. There's only one way to do that. Let the Sheik go.
So we do have the Sheik?
You think our government operates as a single coherent entity? Devereaux just... pushed the agenda. Of course the President was completely unaware of it.
Of course.
Now we can't just let him go. America has to stand tall in the world yadda yadda yadda. So what we do is... We let the American justice system do its work.
I'll be right up, darling.
You have kids? They're great. Sometimes you just want to... drug them.
What do you mean, let the justice system do its work.
We don't release him. A judge releases him. You're an FBI man. That's what judges are good at, right? It's not like we've gone after him in proper prosectorial fashion. Kidnaping him. Holding him in isolation. "Fruit of the poisoned tree" -- remember that one from law school? Oh, we'll have a big trial. Everybody'll get their rocks off... But the fact is -- -- the sheik will walk.
...And this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle.
Documentary evidence of Devereaux's whole operation.
Why me?
Because you'll know what to do with it.
And what about her?
Who?
You know who. How much is she complicit in all this?
Ask her.
I ran an Iraqi network for two years. Samir recruited them from among the Sheik's followers. I trained them in the North. Then we played them back into Baghdad, two, three at a time, hiding them in the mosques...
It was gonna be beautiful. -- And then there was a policy shift --
-- The new doctrine was Iran will be too powerful if Iraq falls apart. And it's not like... we sold them out. Exactly. We just... stopped... helping them. And I wasn't allowed to tell them what was coming down. I was ordered not to tell them. -- And they got slaughtered.
You've got to understand -- these people... believe. Paradise. Bliss. To us they're just words. But to them... It's very beautiful, actually. And when you look at their lives, the heartbreak... And what do we do? We think, aha, we can take advantage of that. So I quit. I came home. I just can't... do it... anymore.
-- But first, you helped them.
What do you mean --?
They were being slaughtered. They needed to get out. But they were on the watch list. So you got them visas. You and Samir.
I promised we would take care of them. They were working... for us.
Doing what, exactly?
I don't know what you mean.
You said you trained them. Tradecraft. Subversion. That's what you said, right? Only you left something out, didn't you... Didn't you, Sharon? You taught them how to make bombs.
-- And now they're here, doing what you taught 'em.
And I'm going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life.
Ahhhhhh...
In case you decide to go on walkabout.
How did you make contact?
He is Afghani. Ahhhh. He got word to my uncle at the bath-house. You never met him.
But you're sure he'll show up.
Sharon, they are all dead but the last cell and they are crazy with fear. Just tell me the message and I will pass it on.
I need to deliver it in person. Believe me, they'll want to hear what I have to say.
You watch the game?
Kannell was really on.
Think they'll make the play-offs?
How's your boy?
He's alright. Thanks for getting him out.
That's Samir.
Green is about right.
He's terrified. Then again, so am I.
You sure he'll go through with it?
If he doesn't he knows I'll give him to Devereaux. How's it feel to be on the other end of it?
I like watching better.
This is the endgame, you understand that? If this goes wrong --
Nothing's going wrong.
We're the CIA, something always goes wrong.
I don't suppose there's any way you would trust me to do this on my own? I thought not. Well, in case it gets hairy, remember... the most committed wins.
I trust her about as far as I can throw her.
That far?
This is not the way to the bath-house. You said to get a key from my uncle so that we --
Shhhhhh... If you'd stop whining you'd feel the surveillance.
Wait for the light to turn yellow and then cross against the traffic.
-- North on Ditmas Avenue.
Sharon, please, I beg you. Do not make me do this. If they even dream we are being followed they will kill us.
Sit. Raise your arm.
What are you doing?
They cannot even dream we are being followed, isn't that what you said?
It is all so... tragic.
...They're going to hit the march.
Arab and Jew, side by side. Black and White, Christian and Muslim --
-- so American. Can you imagine a better target?
Get me Devereaux.
Here. Put this on. We don't want our friends sweating too much while they wait.
They're getting ready to move. Units 1 and 2, on my signal --
What the --
Ah, microwave.
We've got a problem.
What the --
It's a shroud.
"...sweating too much while they wait."
First she turns off the tv, then she says it.
She knew we were listening.
The hammam.
How soon are they coming?
They'll be here.
What are you doing --?
What message do you have for them, Sharon?
I'll tell them when they're here.
Nobody else is coming, is there?
That's right.
You're the last cell.
There will never be a last cell. You should listen to the young men in that stadium. It is just beginning.
How could I have missed the play --
It was the money. You believe money is power. Belief is power.
-- Just tell me we didn't finance your operation...
The world is a wheel. So... what message do you have for me, Sharon?
They're going to release him.
Praise God. When will he be free --?
A few months at most. First, they have to bring him to trial, but --
-- No.
-- But... that's what you want, isn't it? Why you've done all this --
No. It's not.
I want you to bleed... as we have bled.
Samir, the Koran preaches --
Do not speak to me of the Koran, woman. You take our leader. A holy man. You put him in prison for preaching the word of God. You must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live.
But it's over, your point's been made, why spill any more blood? Those poor people out there in the street, they're fucking marching for your cause...
Yes. And they, too, will become its martyrs.
Let her go and you'll live.
Move away from the door.
NO --!!!
Let her go and you'll live --
DON'T --!!!!
GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!!
SAMIR --!
YOU WANT TO DIE --!!
No way you're going out there.
MOVE AWAY --!
Shoot.
Shut up.
Shoot.

SHOOT ME --!!!
I... CAN'T --!

No --!!!
It is God's will.
If there is a God, he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name.
Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --!
Is... he... dead?
...Shhhhhhh...
...no... regrets...
You... knew.
I... wondered.
Sharon... SHARON --
... Emma... My name... is Emma.
-- what are you? I don't...
"I... seek refuge... king of kings..."
Allah Ahkbar --
Amen.
I want to talk about a free society.
Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID staff. Because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison.
The last cell has been taken down. It was Samir. I took him out.
What makes you so sure he was the last cell?
Sharon.
Sharon is not trustworthy.
Sharon is dead. She gave her life. This is a writ from the US District Court releasing all those being held here without habeus corpus.
My authority supersedes the civilian judiciary under the decree of martial law. Sorry.
Your authority ends now. It's all over.
What's over.
They're going to release him.
Release him?
The Sheik. Clear violation of international law, Congressional oversight statutes, a couple of treaties, the Federal perjury statute, and my favorite, the Logan Act, for conducting your own personal foreign policy. I know the whole story, General.
You don't know shit. Poor suffering Sharon and her poor suffering people. It's called "going native" -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it. She had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it. And now they're getting exactly what they want, which is the Sheik will be back in the mix. But ten times as strong, because now he's the big man who stood up to the Americans. I did what was necessary. I make no apologies. If you think you're going to be able to use that file against me, you know even less about politics than I imagined.
General. I'm not in politics. You can have this back. I won't use it.
Because you don't have the balls. Did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude? You serve your country. Is there anything else?
I said I wasn't in politics. I'm not. I'm in law enforcement.
William Devereaux, you are under arrest for the torture and murder of Tariq Husseini under color of authority, United States Code Title 42, Chapter 21, Subchapter 1, Sections
Did we win or did we lose --?

Have you brought the medicines?
Soon.
Why the hell didn't you bring them? CUT TO:
Thirty deaths yesterday, eighteen the day before, the disease is killing our men faster than enemy bullets. The Captain stops at a young AMERICAN MERCENARY'S cot. He's shaking with fever. His skin is mottled and looks like the pulp of an orange. His voice is a whisper:
We'll get you home, soldier. First, I need a tissue sample. He pulls from his black bag a long metal syringe and plunges the biopsy needle deep into the man's liver. He places the needle in an aluminum test tube and seals it.

We'll get you home. CUT TO:
Not just supplies, but doctors and nurses. And suits like yours to protect us. This disease spreads too fast.
The plane tonight will bring everything. CUT TO:
Don't ever -- ever -- tell me what I have to do. CUT TO:
ThE Male Nurse, and dozens of soldiers rush across the forest to the makeshift runway beside the camp. In the distance a camouflaged DC-3 is rapidly approaching.




I rescue you from certain death and instead of gratitude, you mock me. His two WOLFHOUNDS, Olser and Harvey, GROVEL on the floor contritely, each with a worn shoe in his mouth. Behind them we see the rest of Gillespie's living/dining room. His townhouse is spartan; it needs a woman's touch. Un- packed boxes stand in the corner beside a treadmill.
That can't go unpunished. No Letterman for three nights. The dogs wag the running shoes. CUT TO:

Okay! Okay! Without breaking stride, he throws what look like sticks high into the air. The dogs jump and catch the objects in their mouths and race back to Gillipsie. We see they're old stethoscopes with thick rubber tubing. Gillespie lets them fly again. He laughs at their eager- ness and keeps running, sprinting now, trying to prove to himself that he's still young. Suddenly -- a PHONE RINGS. Without breaking stride, he pulls a cellular phone from his pocket:
Dr. Gillespie... How many dead?...
Almost an entire village. INTERCUT WITH:
Is is Lassa Fever? Ebola? What?
How the hell do I know? I'm the bureaucrat, you're the detective, remember? All I know is State wants us to lend a hand and when the Secretary talks, I listen. And when I talk, you listen. You're Code Red. The plane's leaving at 01:30.

Yes, sir. Gillespie hangs up, out of breath... excited. CUT TO:
Mike. ROBERTA "ROBBY" KEOUGH, an attractive, intelligent woman in her mid 30's, opens the door a few inches, until the latch LOCK CHAIN SNAPS tight. The dogs try to push inside.
Hey, guys!
Robby, I know I'm the last guy you'd do a favor for, but I've got no one else to ask.
My lawyer said not to talk to you anymore.
Then just listen. I gotta go to Zaire. Robby shakes her head, "No, no way."

Put 'em in a kennel.
So they can die of some weird disease like Stripes did? She mouths the word "no."
-- Look, Robby, if I had any other choice, I wouldn't be here.
You should've let me have them. You can't take care of them. Beat. Robby's torn. The dogs nuzzle against her leg.
I won't be gone long.
You know I'm moving to Atlanta -- they want me to start in four days.
I'll be back before that.
Four days is four weeks -- to you. Silence.
It wasn't all my fault, Robby.
I know. A long beat.
I'll look after them on one condition if you're not back in four days, they're mine. Gillespie doesn't like it.
Okay.

In writing. She unlatches the door and moves inside. The dogs race after her. Gillespie enters...
Hey, guys, c'mon! They follow her in.
Guess what I got? The DOGS BARK excitedly.
Damn straight! She opens the freezer, grabs a couple of frozen bagels and flips them to the DOGS. They catch the bagels and start
I missed you guys so much. Gillespie hands her the note.
'I, Michael Gillespie, agree that if I'm not back in exactly four days from now, the ownership of my dogs, Osler and Harvey, will go to Roberta Keough.' Time and date it. He does. She points to a huge box on the kitchen table:

That's stuff from med school... Some of it's yours. I don't know if you want any of it. He fishes through it, shoving aside old medical books and equipment. He finds an old wood stethoscope with thick rubber tubing. He shoves in into his pocket.
Got a place yet?
An apartment.
The first thing you'll do is spend the whole night unpacking... You'll stay up 'til dawn but you'll get everything in its place.
Probably.
Nothin' in my life has been organized since you left, Robby. Beat. She's surprised at his admission. And un- comfortable. So's he. He continues searching through the box and pulls out... A photo taken during their honeymoon cruise they're both smiling radiantly as they hold between them a trophy of a dancing couple.
Y'know, this is the only evidence on Earth that I was ever graceful. He checks her reaction. There is a hint of a smile.
Take it.
Nah, people might see it... get the wrong impression. He drops the photo back in the box and moves toward the door.

Four days.
Or less. As we hear the front DOOR OPEN and SHUT, HOLD ON Robby a hint of regret. CUT TO:
Blood in the freezer over the right wing. C'mon! Gut it! We're late. The private grunts and pushes the dolly slowly up the ramp. Izzy lends a hand, and the two of them run it up the ramp. Mike Gillespie, dressed in a uniform, climbs down from the cockpit. Now we see his rank Colonel.
Where the hell's Yaffe?
His wife... she's due tomorrow. I put him on leave.
We need him now! Who's going to read the electron micrographs?
I will.

You can't even read a Playboy pinup.
He said he'd get a guy to fill in.
We can't wait. A Jeep drives across the tarmac, toward them and comes to a park a short distance away. The Driver scurries out to open the passenger door to let -- General Ford get out.
What does he want? The driver pulls two suitcases out of the Jeep and follows Ford into the plane.
I'm comin' along, Mike.
Sir, we're going into very dangerous territory.
I'm well aware of the dangers.
Beggin' your pardon, General, I don't think you are. You've had only the most cursory training on how to avoid contamination. Concerns for your safety would distract us.
Nothing distracts you, Colonel. You won't even know I'm there.
Sir, I'm not comfortable --
Mike, have a little compassion for an old man who's been rotting behind a desk.


For once I'd like to be there when one of these buggers hits. You're not going to tell me I can't go, Colonel, are you?
No, sir.
Good. I feel wanted, now. I get airsick in the back. I'll be up with the pilot.
The guy wouldn't know a virus from a Barbie Doll. I'm not lookin' after him. He's yours.
Bullshit.
All of a sudden, playing golf and pushin' papers isn't good enough. Damn, when I'm his age, that's all I'm gonna want to do. Gillespie flips a coin, covers it over his wrist.
Heads. No! Tails.
Fuck! Gillespie grabs the phone to the cockpit.
Rafferty, rock and roll with this bird.
Wait! Mike follows his eyes out to the --
Captain Walter Salt reporting, sir. Izzy smiles. He looks at Gillespie, who is impressed but won't show it.
I'm sorry to be late, sir. I was wrapping up some tests in my lab --
-- Strap in. The huge JET ENGINES come to life. Gillespie, Berman, and Salt strap themselves into the row of jump seats along the fuselage. Issy is filled with the excitement of a young kid who can't believe his luck:
You're not the football player from West Point, that Salt?
The same, sir.
I thought you had the Heisman sewed up 'til you hurt your knee.

You and my mother, Major... I was never that good. But thank you for saying so, sir.
Don't call me sir. The only one who does that is the Colonel here. Everyone else calls me Izzy.
Izzy, sir?
My mother calls me Isaac, but I hate it. I pitched for my high school team. My dad thought I was gonna be another Dizzy Dean. So he called me 'Izzy.'
Yes, sir, Izzy, sir. The plane surges forward and taxis down the runway.
I want to know just one thing. Can you read electron micrographs as well as you can run?
I'm not sure how to assess the question --
-- Just say 'yes, sir,' Captain. Whatever the Colonel asks, you just say 'yes, sir.' That's how we keep him under control.
Have you ever seen filovirus infection in a human being?
No, sir.
It's about as pretty as goin' naked up the middle against the Dallas Cowboys.

I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, sir. Whatever it is, I can handle it.
I hope so, because if you can't, you'll make a mistake. You'll be holding a needle and it'll slip. Or your glove will have a crack in it and you won't notice. You work with filoviruses, it's like working with plutonium. A single drop of blood can hold six billion... That's more filoviruses than there are people in the world. You get a single one of those inside you, you're infected. Say you're lucky and it's one of the few filoviruses we have antiserum for. Then we can treat you and you'll probably live. But say you're unlucky. And you get one of those filoviruses we don't have an antiserum for, which is most of them. There's no medicine, no cure, nothing we can do to help you. Your body gets so hot, your liver, your kidney, all your vital organs melt, and your skin turns into tapioca pudding. Stunned silence.
He means chocolate pudding. Salt smiles slowly. He likes Izzy. The WHEELS come up with a THUMP. The giant jet shakes and rattles and soars into the air. SHOCK CUT TO:

How do you breath in here?
With a respirator. Positive pressure's what you want. Keep those buggers out. Izzy flips the switch on Ford's respirator, which sucks air out of the atmosphere, filters it, and pumps it into the suit. Ford starts to swell up like the Pillsbury doughboy.
And I thought it was a hassle wearin' a tie all day.
We got a lot of equipment. You're gonna have to get us in close.
Then don't kiss me, Sergeant. CUT TO:
Captain Salt, if you fail to observe strict decontamination protocol, three things can happen. First, you can be court-martialed. Second, you can die from this horrible disease. Third, and worst of all, you can incur my displeasure. You got it?
Yes, sir.
If one of us gets sick, we all get sick. And I didn't come here to die.

Doctor Iwabi? I brought blood, plasma --
-- You're too late.
I came as soon as I could.
It wouldn't have mattered when you came. This one is different -- worse than Lassa, worse even than Ebola. It strikes and kills so fast. The young, the healthy, everybody.
Who was the index case?
A road construction worker.
How did he get it?
We don't know. He died three days ago. Salt moves ahead to the next bed and pulls aside the thin mosquito curtain to inspect the patient. Ford is right behind him.
God...

I'm gonna be sick. He starts to rip off his mask. Gillespie grabs his arms.
Keep you helmet on, Goddamit!
I can't breath. Salt vomits in his helmet. Rips it off. He rushes out. Izzy moves after him.
Put him in quarantine. Now!
You don't need to.
Why?
It's not spread in the air.
How do you know?
There's no cough. Or we'd all be dead. For days we've been working with only these masks. They can't keep out a particle as small as a virus.
Could any infected person have gotten out of this village and spread it?
The incubation period is only one or two days. The mortality is one hundred percent.


If anyone got out, they are dead, or will be soon. And if they have spread the disease, we will know rather quickly.
Finding the host is the only way to control the spread. Our only hope is that this is like most viruses and that it has to live in a host, an animal, to which it's adapted over thousands of years. And that animal host has developed antibodies to protect itself against the virus. If we can identify that animal host, and harvest its antibodies, we can use them to fight the disease in humans.
There are a hundred thousand species of animals and insects in this rain forest. The construction worker could have been in contact with any one of them. Where do I start?
Of course, we'll do whatever we can. CUT TO:

What's he saying?
He's asking for forgiveness from the Gods of the forest. They're angry because they've been awoken from their sleep by the men building the road. These deaths are their punishment.
Why isn't he sick?
He stayed in his cave all week and greeted his visitors with poison darts.

A memo to the CDC to issue a warning to every physician in the United States to be on the look-out for this disease? What the hell is this?
A safeguard, sir.
Are you nuts? Within a week we'll know if this thing burned itself out in that village, just like Iwabi said --
-- And if Iwabi's wrong? American doctors should be warned so cases can be quarantined. Sir, this one is different --
-- You're a smart guy, Gillespie, but you can't write a memo to the CDC which says the sky is falling.
We should do nothing?
Did I say that, Colonel? We will monitor the situation in Africa, and if this virus reappears, we will act with all our resources, not just to protect the American people but the people of the world. You will destroy this memo. That's an order. Gillespie's frustrated.
Yes, sir. SMASH CUT TO:

You asked for four days and four days it was... last night.
It was a bad virus... Cut me some slack.
I cut you ten years of slack. I'm not giving you the dogs.
Stop joking. Where are they?
I shipped them this morning.
You did not. ON her face a triumphant smile.
It's better for them. And for you. I'll be there to feed them and take care of them. You won't have to feel guilty. She moves past the gate. Gillespie's stuck behind it. Screaming after her:
I'm coming to Atlanta... I'm takin' 'em back.
Dream on. HOLD ON Gillespie's dismay as she disappears. CUT TO:

Piss ass good. And you?
Admit it, for chrissakes The dogs will get better care with her than they got with you.
That really cheers me up.
You think cause we're friends I should ignore reality.
I think cause we're friends you might show some tact.

You were gone so often that when you were home... you spoiled 'em. Robby keeps an even keel.
Hey, she's available...
Don't think I haven't thought about it.
You're just what she's looking for. Mr. Stability. Three wives in five years.
Two. I never married Sherry. I liked her too much... Izzy pulls a red air hose down from the ceiling and in- flates his space suit before he puts it on; this is stan- dard safety procedure. Mike steps right into his suit.
What are you doing?
What?
You forgot to test your suit. Look! It's torn. There is a small tear on the left leg of Gillespie's suit.
If I let you die, who've I got to rag on? FADE UP the sound of furiously RUSHING AIR, then CUT TO:

Good afternoon, Colonel, sir.
I thought you were doing your thesis at Walter Reede.
A lot's been published on Herpes B but nothing on this new virus.
So you were hoping to change subjects and get your name on my research papers?
Our research papers.
I would do my share of the work, sir. More.
And you wouldn't have to worry about anybody publishing the same thing cause there ain't nobody else crazy enough to work with this dangerous a virus. Salt hesitates, then beams.

Yes, sir! Have you given the virus a name, sir?
Motaba... after the valley where we found it.
I like it, sir.
Like it? Listen to the way it rolls off your tongue. Mo-ta-ba. Like a perfume.
One drop and you feel... so different... Your lover will never recognize you again. Have some, Captain.
Good hands... That's important for working with level 4 viruses. Salt, trembling, notes that the vial is made of plastic.
This plastic is unbreakable, right?
So far.

Sir. He's here early. No coffee breaks.
Should we let this guy horn in on our new virus, Owi? Owi hesitates.
I don't think so.
Well, that's that. Salt nervously eyes Izzy "Is this a joke?"
Captain, Sergeant Owigatsuyama here not only looks after everything in this lab, but since he knows the birthday of every great tenor and soprano who ever lived, Dr. Gillespie looks to him for supreme guidance on all matters.
Just a minute! I could've changed the radio to jazz. I love jazz. But I didn't. Whaddya haveta do to get on here?
Get me a blood test for the Motaba Virus.
With a PCR catalyst I should be able to have a crude -- and I underscore crude -- screening test in a few weeks.

Excellent. But nobody's asking you to work a hundred and fifty hours a week...
A hundred and twenty will be plenty.
Welcome aboard, Captain. CUT TO:

The world is round, Gillespie. Didn't anybody fucking teach you? He grabs a metal file off the tool board and files down the side of the bench until it's perfectly smooth and round. Then moves on to... One of the huge circular freezers in the center of the lab. He punches in a seven-digit code on the keypad and the LOCK SNAPS OPEN. He lifts the heavy lid. VAPOR RUSHES OUT. He looks inside, sees the 65 aluminum test tubes labeled "Motaba." CUT TO:
Tell the boys the Old Man wants the answer tonight. McCLINTOCK Yes, sir. McClintock places the test tube into a clear plexiglass container which is contained within a large plexiglass container, each with its own combination lock. He twirls the tumblers. The LOCKS SNAP into place. CUT TO:
You fucker, why couldn't you stay dead? CUT TO:

The rebels hit Iwabi's camp.
I know. He swivels around in his chair to the world map on the wall.
They hit Kisangani, Bukavu, and Mbandaka as well. Three hundred thousand acres of forest burned, at least thirty-seven dead. I'm trying to find out about Iwabi.
He's all right, thank God. He was in Kinshasha at his clinic but his entire field staff was killed. His whole lab destroyed.
Terrible.
I want to continue working on Motaba, sir.
Look, as a scientist, I appreciate the fact that this one fascinates you --
-- It scares the shit out of me, sir.
Colonel, the Pentagon's biting my ass cause we're months behind on the Anthrax studies. Get 'em finished. Take the heat off me.


Then you can fiddle with Motaba as much as you like.
Sir, if this virus came to America --
-- Then it'd be outside our mandate. The CDC takes care of civilian problems. Christ, now you've even got me buying into your paranoia. We can't protect everybody against everything. We've got to make decisions based on the odds, and the odds of Motaba causing us any more trouble are a billion to one.
Every sample of Motaba gone... Where the fuck did he put it? Owi looks contrite.
General Ford ordered me to move all tubes to the sealed vault in A wing... Only he has access. He said you weren't gonna need it for months. Gillespie and his men are despondent.
Those were the only samples in the world of Motaba, Iwabi lost all his in the fire. There's got to be a way to get that access code from Ford's computer.
Sir, I don't want any more trouble.


It's bad enough that I already made one mistake and forgot to transfer one of the tubes of Motaba. I seemed to have mixed it up with a tube of common cold virus. If I give you the tube, I'm sure you'll fix my mistake, sir. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a gleaming aluminium test tube with the words "Motaba #48" written on the side.
I love it when you make mistakes, Owi.
How do you know? I never made one before now. Hold on their grins, FADE UP the sound of FURIOUSLY RUSHING WIND and CUT TO:
Wait'll I get my new traps. The world'll never be the same. The Guard raises the gate and Jimbo drives forward. CUT TO:
Cars put babies to sleep, why not you? Betsy takes a mouthful of water and spits it on Jimbo. His reaction is instant rage. He slams the cage:
You stupid fucking monkey! Why'dya wanna go and do that? He shoves the cage further away. Then he sees it - a small cut on his hand, caused by a couple of wire pro- trusions on the cage. He rubs the blood off on his shirt. The Nissan roars down the road. CUT TO:
A normal healthy liver cell. The image changes.
Infected cell. The infected cell is swollen and filled with black brick- like structures.
Bricks of virus. They multiply until... The image changes the bricks have completely overrun the cell, shattering its outer membrane so that bricks run rampant inside and outside the cell.

They explode the cell and destroy it. Then they move on to the next healthy cell. And the next. 'Til there's nothing left to kill.
There's our guy, Mr. Motaba.
Ugly bastard, isn't he?
I wouldn't let him date my sister. CUT TO:
The blood test. Normal is this -- pure purple. But if you're infected... Focus changes and another image fills the screen the field is filled with wide patches of red circles. Gillespie and Berman each peer into the scope.
If you're red, you're dead. Is that what you're telling me?
That's right, Colonel. The virus doesn't know the Cold War is over.


But the rest is just a quickie; I haven't had time to refine it. There are false negatives, purples that should be red. I don't know why yet.
How long to fix it?
Hard to say.
How long?
Hey, don't pressure the kid! It took the NIH guys eight months to get the kinks outa the AIDS test... And they didn't have to put up with your nagging. SMASH CUT TO:
This bug definitely ate its Wheaties.
It survives in air for twelve hours, and it survives in water for two hours.
Bullshit.

Hey, this little bugger's so hardy it can read the whole Sunday NY Times and not die, it can run the hundred in nine flat, and it can kill fish faster than my cat. Voila! A fish tank with a dozen dead fish floating on top.
No test species has survived, even when I've treated them with all antivirals, including every damn antiserum. What's even worse is there's a latency phase. Iwabi didn't see this in Zaire, I don't know why, but some of the animals I've tested had the infection a long time before they showed any symptoms. They even tested negative but had the disease. If this is true of humans... why we could have it ourselves and not know it.
Yet be spreading it.
Exactly.
Holy shit.
You got the papers and all?

Yeah, sure... I got the papers. She's legal.
Whaddya mean 'she'? Betsy takes advantage of the opening and bolts out of the cage, heading for the window. As Rudy and Jimbo both chase after her, Rudy is steaming.
I told you a male.
You said 'she'.
Bullshit! I said 'he'. The customer's already got a female Colobos. He wants to breed 'em. Betsy slams against the glass. Rudy grabs her.
C'mon, baby... c'mon. She lashes out at his naked forearm, digging her nails into him, drawing blood. He yelps and lets go, and she runs away to the other side of the room, passing the brown rhesus, who eyes a half-eaten banana in Betsy's cage. He grabs it and scarfs it down. Jimbo finally grabs Betsy from behind. Rudy grabs her from the front and they thrust her back into her cage. Rudy wipes the blood off his arm.
Get this bitch outa here.
What about my money?
Go back and get me a male Colobos.
We ain't got one. This was the only Colobos we had... Look, I'll sell her cheap.
I wouldn't take her for free.


I can't even sell this one.
Hey, I need some money now, man. Rudy hesitates.
I done you a lot of favors. Rudy pulls out a billfold.
All right... Fifty bucks for your expenses. A lot more when you bring me a male.
What am I going to do with her? Rudy shrugs. CUT TO:
Look at all the trees. It's like home. Jimbo jabs her lightly with a drumstick. She runs out of the cage but stops at the edge of the road, afraid of the forest she doesn't know.
C'mon, get. Get! She scampers off into the forest. Jimbo follows her with his eyes, a little saddened. CUT TO:
Someplace they don't have lawmen. He goes to the back of the plane where's it's deserted, and lies down across three seats. His body shakes with a chill. He pulls the blanket tight against his chest. CUT TO:
Some little brat gave me his cold. She plants a kiss on him and pats his ass.
Dr. Gillespie wants us to send out a special bulletin warning all physicians to watch out for any symptoms of a virus from Zaire named 'Motaba.' He thinks it's serious enough to warrant emergency reporting nationwide, that it can't wait for our regular monthly report.
Which will be released next week, correct?
Wednesday.

To get out a special bulletin for four hundred thousand health professionals is about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Dr. Gillespie says it's the worst virus he's ever studied --
-- Forgive me, Robby, but this is the guy who found three cases of Congo Fever in Nairobi in '87, and suddenly it's in every American kid's lunch box --
-- You're not being fair --
In '91 he said Tsutsugamushi Fever was coming. In '92 it was Ebola. His panics cost us plenty. Around here he's known as Doctor Doom.
He could've been right about any of them. Rule out the worst first... that's what my father always taught.
Your father was one of the greatest Surgeon Generals this country ever had. He took me under his wing and let me fly. I've always been grateful. And I've always had a special feeling for you, Robby. The... pain it gave him to see you working under Gillespie... all your promise... the man never gave you a chance to show it. A long silence. Drew has hit home.
Look, is there a shred of evidence that Motaba is more transmissible than the other filoviruses we've seen in the past?

No.
Then as long as the bulletin goes out next week, we're covered. CUT TO:
An E-Coli outbreak in Michigan at a couple of Ronny's steakhouse franchises.
And -- a couple of fevers of unknown origin at Boston Municipal that the infectious disease docs can't figure out. That's all we've got on the log.
The Boston case is not some guy out of Zaire... with Motaba, is it?
Yeah, right! Nah, it's a couple of Americans. No unusual travel.
They've probably got some atypical strain of Lyme and the Boston doctors have just missed the boat.
Then let's see if we can throw them a lifeline.
I'm fine, Mrs. Foote... it's hot. That's all. Lemme open a win-- Suddenly his face twitches, his body stiffens, his eyes roll back and he falls to the floor, convulsing violently. Mrs. Foote screams. CUT TO:
C'mon, Rudy, talk to me! No response. Dr. Mascelli rubs his knuckles into Rudy's chest. Rudy groans.

And now he's in shock with pneumonia. Get me some blood cultures. Henry nods as he fills a lavendar-topped tube with Rudy's blood.
I've been reading about real bad strep cases. I bet this is one of 'em. Emma, don't leave him alone. His heart could stop any minute.
Damn!

You washed it out. Don't worry. But just in case, I'll put you on some penicillin prophylactically.
I wouldn't want to give it to my girl friend.
Cheer up, the penicillin'll kill that, too.
Nothin'. Just thirsty... Lemme get something to drink and I'll be okay. Henry heads up the aisle in the darkened theatre.

Could I please get something to drink? TRACY, the salesgirl with a spiked haircut regards him with a hostile glance.
Please -- I'm not feeling too good. A large Coke. Or Pepsi. I don't care. At the front of the line, a black woman with a streak of purple in her hair holds her toddler in her arms. She sees that Henry is ill.

Mister Scott -- Jimbo... We're trying to figure out how you got this disease. It's important, so try to help me. You work at an animal facility in San Jose -- Jimbo's eyes are blank. He's dead.
I don't know. That's why we'll need a post.

Go very carefully, very slowly. Maximum sharps precautions. Sweat drips off Boston Doctor #3's face, fogging his visor. He starts to make the first cut, but his hand is trembling too much.
Don't let your eyes leave the blade. Ever. And you'll be okay. Doctor #3 cuts deep into Jimbo's ribs but no matter how slowly he cuts, the sharp edge of the scalpel seems too close to his fingers. PULL BACK to reveal they're doing the autopsy in a plastic tent using negative pressure suction pumps. As the PUMPS WHIR... CUT TO:
It's as if they swallowed a bomb and it went off inside them.


I don't know if it's Motaba but it sure looks like what Gillespie described. INTERCUT WITH:
at her kitchen table. Petrified. We see she's been working late her laptop's on, papers are strewn about.
How many were exposed?
Too many. The medical staff didn't know what they were dealing with so they didn't take precautions. They're scared outa their minds. Julio gazes through the glassed-in walls at the half- dozen pathology residents and nurses, peering at him with worried expressions. He spins around in his chair so he doesn't have to see them.
That's just the beginning. Patient zero -- this guy Jimbo Scott -- worked in an animal quarantine facility in San Jose, California. That's probably where he picked it up. Probably the whole place is infected by now and is gonna have to be nuked. It gets worse. Jimbo here takes a goddamn plane from Portland to Boston. The plane stopped in Chicago. Two hundred and eight people on the first leg, and Christ, something like two hundred and fifty on the second! If this guy was infectious, by now the whole country's been exposed. And Gillispie says there's no treatment for this mother, nothing to do but pronounce people dead. What are we supposed to do, Robby? Christ, what the hell are we supposed to do?

Gillespie said Motaba only spreads by direct contact, that the disease isn't airborne. Was patient zero coughing? Sanchez flips through Scott's medical record.
I don't see anything about his coughing.
Then the people on the plane are probably okay. But we're going to have to check every one of them out. Plus all the medical staff who worked on him and his girl friend. Plus all their recent contacts.
-- That's thousands of people --
-- I don't see a choice --
-- This whole hospital is buzzin' with rumors... it's gonna hit the press real soon. What are we gonna tell them?
That the C.D.C. is investigating the situation, but we do not feel there's reason for alarm. I know it's scary, Julio, but the truth is we don't know what it is yet.
Gillespie's the only one who can tell us. Robby has mixed emotions the last person she wants to involve is her ex-husband.
Send him everything by stat courier.
Got it.

This is Dr. Keough. Put out a stage three alert.
Zebra, Apple, Charley, Kill.
Great! Now get the list of all his friends in San Jose. I want to know every contact the last last five days. She hangs up, turns to Lisa Aronson, on the phone at the next desk.
Paitent Zero didn't take a commercial plane to Portland. Presumably he went by car. Fax every emergency room in the Portland area a description of the disease. Then hit every hospital along every freeway from San Jose to Portland.
Right.

We don't even have confirmation. This could all be for noth --
-- Worst first. My father never made the same mistake twice. Reynolds is humbled. CUT TO:
Henry, we got it early, and you're gonna make it. But I need you to fight. Henry stares at him with blank eyes.
I don't know.
C'mon, for chrissakes. Salt shifts to another field, looks at it long and hard. Pulls his head back hopelessness in his eyes. CUT TO:
P.C.R. tests are tricky. It's easy to make a mistake --
-- Yeah, I followed your orders instead of my gut. He grabs the phone and punches in a long distance number.
I should've blasted our African findings across every newspaper in the country. Robby.
You're sure? Reynolds drops the ball. Around the room shock; even though they all anticipated the positive result, nobody can quite believe it.
You need my help, Robby. Robby, flustered, doesn't answer.
I know this virus, you don't. I've worked this virus, you haven't. How many people are infected?

How many?
We don't know. We've only got a whole emergency room full of people in Bonneville, Oregon, and we don't know what they've got.
How could that many people get infected so fast?
We're not sure.
Robby, don't get anywhere near this thing. Robby doesn't answer.
You've been in an office for years. You've forgotten what these things are like.
I worked with the A.I.D.S. virus.
That's level two, nothing! This is level four. Stay the fuck away, Robby.

Please, Robby. Stay away.
I need to be able to test a lot of people and quickly. I need the primer --

Why has it always been so hard for you to admit that you need anything from me?
I don't have time to fight with you. I'll have a courier pick up the primer at 01:00. She hangs up without giving him a chance to respond.
Robby!
Request permission to bring my team to Bonneville, Oregon, sir.
Request denied. Civilian infections are not within our mandate --
-- A Presidential order can override --
Let the C.D.C. do its job. If they need help, they know we're here.
The Goddamn fuse is lit! What're you gonna do? Wait for the bomb to go off?
We don't live in the African bush. We don't crap in our streets, we don't drink dirty well water filled with spit. The disease will be stopped.
Yeah? Today, maybe they've got a handful... By tomorrow they could have a hundred, and the day after that, a thousand. When the President and Congress ask why you didn't bring in one group, the only group in the entire world with experience in fighting this disease, what're you gonna say?

You don't obey orders, Gillespie. You're the last person I'd send.
I'm sending a letter to the Surgeon General right now. I'm going to create a paper trail. You will fry. Gillespie storms out. Ford remains unruffled.
Sergeant, this is Colonel Gillespie at Fort Detrick. We're on code red status for Bonneville, Oregon. Time of departure 01:00.
Is that Mucia with a 'C' or an 'S'?

Get it done, Sergeant. That's a direct oroder from General Ford.
The C.D.C. asked us? That doesn't sound like them.
They're going to have to show the President they did everything possible. There's a nervousness in Izzy's face, something we've seen before.
Get a bunch of paper pushers scared enough, they'll do anything. CUT TO:

The genie's out of the bottle in Bonneville, Oregon, Donny, and we've got to get him back in. General McClintock looks dumb.
Cancel all leaves. Mobilize all personnel. I'm going to want wind conditions and transmission rates -- for all insects, animals, marine, and human vectors. If this virus is spreading, I want to know how fast and where. He looks at his computer monitor, which projects a map of Western Oregon the town of Bonneville is close to the Columbia River.
Bonneville's only five miles from the Columbia River and if this mother gets there, we're in big shit trouble. CUT TO:

Tell him it is Colonel Mike Gillespie, Commander of the U.S. Army Motaba Virus Task Force. INTERCUT WITH:
Give that to me one more time, Colonel.
We've got to quarantine the entire town of Bonneville and do it quick. Morning will be too late -- people will panic and try to leave. If even one infected person gets out, the entire effort could be for nothing.
Why can't the State Police do it?
They can shut down the major roads, but we need a much larger force to encircle the town.
Where would I get troops at this hour and have 'em in Bonneville, Oregon before sunrise?
Fort Lewis, Washington, or Ford Ord, California. Closer is better. Sir, this is a doomsday disease.


As deadly as A.I.D.S., but it kills within days. It could spread over the entire country. Goodell's wide awake now.
Does your commanding officer know about this?
Yes, sir, of course. He asked me to call you.
Colonel, all I can do is refer the matter to the National Security Council. An action of this scope would require the President's approval.
Then get it, sir. Right away, please. They break radio contact. Salt looks at Gillespie with awe.
If the C.D.C. asked us to help, why did you have to call the Defense Secretary? Why didn't General Ford make the call? Gillespie shifts uncomfortably. Salt realizes he's in trouble.
You bet your ass, Captain. Colonel Gillespie has taken it upon himself to circumvent the entire chain of command. The plane bounces in the turbulence. Salt turns to Gillespie.
You're shitting me?... Sir?
I'll take full responsibility for whatever happens.

That only means they'll hang you first.
Don't worry, the C.D.C. -- and the President -- will invite us to Bonneville. They'll invite Mary and Jesus too. CUT BACK TO:
I just got a disturbing call from one of your officers, General. INTERCUT WITH:
I can tell the President we're looking at a situation you can contain with minimal loss of life, can't I?
Of course. CUT TO:

Are you crazy? Don't touch them. Those are Level Four viruses. The lead soldier raises his rifle at Owi.
Sergeant, I want every specimen of Motaba Virus in this lab and this time no 'mistakes.' FADE UP COUNTRY MUSIC with a real twang like the JUDDS' "Red Cadillac" and... CUT TO:
What the hell?
Tommy Hull climbs out. The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN raises his shotgun and aims it.

What's goin' on?
What's goin' on? Why are you wearin' all that stuff?

I'm Dr. Roberta Keough from the C.D.C. I'm in charge.
I've got people inside. They can do what needs to be done. Set up your command post outside the town, where you'll be safe. She tries to go around him. He grabs her arm.
Let me do my job. Please. I know what I'm doing. A beat. He reluctantly lets go. She goes inside.
On whose authority are you here, Michael?
Want me to leave? She doesn't answer. We hear only the RUSH of AIR in their SUITS, drowning out the horror we see as they pass room after room of Motaba patients, screaming and moaning in pain. They pass... Izzy in a room with Henry, the lab tech. Lips blue, gasping for every breath, he fights against the vent- ilator. Streaks of blood line the wall. In the next bed is his girl friend, Corinne, comatose and near death.

I tried to warn you. But nothing he could have said could have prepared her for this. She moves on into...
Bonneville patient zero. He never regained consciousness so we don't know how he got infected. Suddenly Tracy starts convulsing.
More Valium. Quick.
Where's the crash cart?

Dr. Mascelli, we spoke on the phone, I'm Dr. Keough from the
How many of your patients are coughing?
Except for him, all of them. Why? SMASH CUT TO:
The common bond is the movie theatre.
This isn't the same virus --
-- It's mutated --
-- To an airborne form --

My God, if it's spreading through the air, person to person, by droplets, it's... it's the plague. Everybody in the town's gonna die.
They may not all be infected.
But they will be. And if one person gets out --
The quarantine has to be ironclad --
People are gonna get out over the mountains -- it will be impossible to stop them.
You're wrong. FADE UP the ROAR of CHOPPERS. An OVERWHELMING DIM. Dr. Macselli moves to the window, pulls back the shades. Can't believe his eyes. In the distance, against the dawn half-light... the sky is filled with Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopters from the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force.
How...
... Don't ask. CUT TO:
They won't.
I know one place they won't think to go. CUT TO:
You're using rubber bullets, aren't you? Briggs salutes Gillespie. He speaks with a Georgia accent.
You're operating under civilian control in a civilian disater.

The Secretary of Defense and the President have made this a joint operation between the C.D.C. and the United States Army. I've been placed in command. Ford goes straight over to Gillespie. Briggs intercepts him halfway there, salutes, and reports:
There are one thousand two hundred and eighteen people living in this town. I want every one of them accounted for by 09:00.
You're under arrest. With Major Berman and Captain Salt --
-- He was right. We were wrong --
-- Stay out of it, Robby. Gillespie, you violated a direct order --

-- The virus is airborne.
Motaba is only spread by direct fluid contact.
Since it left Africa, it mutated.
That's crazy.
Go to the hospital and see for yourself. Leave your face bare. Ford starts away from Gillespie.
You can't put him in jail. I need him. I need his whole team. Ford thinks for a moment.
Very well. Colonel, you, Major Berman, Captain Salt... can help Dr. Keough for the duration of this crisis, but you cannot leave this town and as soon as we get this under control, you'll be taken into custody.
Major Berman and Captain Salt were following my orders -- I am the only one at fault.
We'll let the court martial decide that. Suddenly Robby's walkie-talkie squawks:
We got the host! FADE UP the cacophony of SHRIEKING ANIMALS and -- CUT TO:
I found this note on the desk... She holds a post-it with the words scribbled across it "Scott - Monkey - 8/31."
This must be the monkey Scott brought up from Biotest.
And if he is the host, his blood will give us a treatment.
He's so cute it's hard to believe he's caused such destruction.
Hitler's girl friend used to say the same thing. Ford stands in the back of the room, disinterested, as if he knows already the brown rhesus is going to lead nowhere. Robby peers into the rhesus's cage.
Why is he so quiet?
Monkeys get quiet when they get hungry...
... Or sick. SMACH CUT TO:

Izzy!
The rhesus falls asleep. Izzy draws blood as a Jeep carrying Ford pulls up, followed by an Army truck. Soldiers empty the truck, piling up crates of plastic IV bags filled with brown fluid.
Filo-four antiserum. Antitoxin. Anyone with symptoms or positive blood tests will get it stat.
What for?
It kills twenty-five percent of filoviruses.
Not Motaba. We tried it.
In the lab. People react differently. Gillespie and Izzy exchange a skeptical glance is Ford losing it, or what?
We have nothing to lose -- the disease is incurable.
General Ford is right.
Thank you. CUT TO:

The Army will begin emergency food deliveries once a day... CUT TO:
... If you have special needs, such as medicine you take, let them know and it'll be delivered to you. But please -- stay inside. Do not go out for any reason.
This disease looks like a regular flu in its early stages, but if you have flu symptoms, don't panic... It's probably just a normal virus and not Motaba.
But the way to protect your family is to detect it early, before you spread it.

Nothing. Mommy's fine. CUT TO:
If you're feeling sick in any way, you should hang a pillowcase or other piece of cloth on your front door. Soldiers will take you somewhere safe for a test. You'll know the result within a few hours. If you're positive, you'll go into one of our isolation hospitals, so bring clothes and personal things you might need.
Turn it off!

We don't have it, goddamn it. But if we stay here, we'll get it.
I know you're scared. We're all scared. But together we're going to get through this. CUT TO:
I'll be back in a few hours. It's like I'm goin' to work. She wipes the tears from her eyes; she's trembling.

Now, promise you won't fight. Promise you'll do what your father tells you. They each promise - nodding "yes" in order from the oldest to the youngest. It's a very solemn moment as Sherry steps onto:
Positive. He takes another tube of blood from a different patient. Looks under the scope.
Positive.
Positive.
The whole fucking town's infected. A sense of despair.
Double check it! Triple check it. CUT TO:
Does this mean my children have it, too?
No... But she sees he's not sure.
Oh my God. CUT BACK TO:
How can this be? Doctor Mascelli can't be negative. I know he's got it. Something's wrong. CUT TO:
... but Izzy doesn't hear it. He continues looking through the scope. Suddenly, he spots the red umbilical cord lying on the floor.
No! Robby grabs the cord and re-inserts it into Izzy's suit; the RUSH OF AIR quickly fills the suit, but --
It was only a few seconds, nothing got in.
I know. I'm fine. Silence.
I can finish the tests --
-- I'm fine.
The virus has changed enough so that the antibodies can't recognize it. We've got to find the host, Donny.

Nature is more generous than man, Donny... it creates more variablity in the antibodies. If we find the host, its antibodies may be effective against the mutated strain. McCLINTOCK That's a guess. And there's no time, no cure. We have no choice but to implement the Emergency Containment Plan. ON Ford's troubled reaction --
He's dying of Motaba. His blood doesn't have any protective antibodies. Nothing. Gloom and defeat sink over the room.
But where did this monkey get the disease?
Christ, it could have been anywhere... Maybe he was on a boat from Africa, next to the host.
Then there's no hope.
No. Unless Jimbo Scott had close contact with the host and that animal is somehow traceable. There's got to be something at Bio-Test.

Lisa, go back there. There's got to be something that was missed. Lisa nods. CUT TO:

Increase the spraying, Goddamnit!
There's got to be a way to deal with it --
I want the most rapid-acting nerve gas. Something so quick they'll never know what hit 'em.
And I've been through all the files... No animal's been removed in the last fourteen days.
Could Jimbo Scott have deleated all traces of an animal stored at your facility?
Mr. Felder, don't take this personally, but either you're a horrible judge of character or the world's in deep shit. Could Jimbo Scott have erased all records on an animal stored at your facility? Yes or no? Felder hesitates. Suddenly Gillespie's WALKIE-TALKIE BEEPS:
Colonel, come quick.
He should be dead. The last of the antiserum drips into the animal's arm.
I gave him the antiserum.
It doesn't work on people. It shouldn't work on simians either.
So how come it worked on this one? Gillespie's mind is racing:

He was infected with the first strain, before it mutated.
It still shouldn't work. This Korean Filo4 doesn't cross-react with the Motaba virus. We checked!
Maybe it's not Korean Filo4.
What else could it be?
I need some air. He takes a step, then starts seizing, his whole body shaking in one convulsive wave after the next. Gillespie, Robby and Wally rush over.
He's slowin' down. He's gonna arrest.
Let's go. Now! With extraordinary effort, he heaves Izzy over his back.
Ice, fluids, blood, oxygen... Let's go! Gillespie puts a probe in Berman's mouth, shudders when he sees the reading.
A hundred and eight. Ice... I want ice... I mean now!

Open your eyes. Open your fuckin' eyes, Izzy. Nobody's lettin' you off so easy. Pressure?
Comin' up. A long, long beat. Berman slowly opens his eyes. Gillespie smiles.
You were a hundred and eight. Not too long... but long enough... You musta lost a billion brain cells.
Now I'm only as smart as you. Gillespie grins. Berman tries to smile. His lip twitches... uncontrolla- bly. His whole body seizes.
We need a line. Robby flips Gillespie a catheter set. He looks for a vein. Robby and Wally try to keep Izzy flat while Gillespie works, but...
Watch out! She shoves Mike's hand out of the path, but the needle nicks her glove. Mike and Wally are horrified.
Lemme see it.

It didn't get past the outer glove. Hold him down. Wally pins Izzy's arm down as Robby sticks in an IV and injects medicine. Izzy stops seizing. CUT TO:
You took the hit for me... Why? Tears fill her eyes. Her mouth opens. She can't talk. Only a low moan of terror. Gillespie cradles her head against his. CUT TO:

That's right. Kill us all. C'mon! They can't hear him or see him. He finishes the last of the bottle and climbs into...
Get the hell out of my way. I'm going to see the General.
That's a load of crap. Get him on the line, soldier. Now!

You go home. Before Guard #2 can react, Hull raises his SHOTGUN and

You had the antiserum to the original African strain, you could've made it available right away. The virus would've never had a chance to mutate. You could have stopped this whole epidemic before it got started. Why? Ford says nothing. He stares at the wreckage as if some- how he could find an answer there he himself believes.
Why?
It's so strange... You look at these viruses under the electron microscope... They're like... like beautiful symmetrical crystals, so cold, so pure. You think you're looking at some fabulous piece of sculpture behind a museum wall... till you see the blood and people dying all around you. I stopped it once. I thought I could stop it again.
You ordered the attack on Iwabi's people in Africa? Silence. Ford neither confirms nor denies the accusation. Then with sadness and remorse, Ford tells the truth:
We had to ensure that we had the only live samples of the virus.
Biowarfare research is illegal. We signed a treaty...
... What do you know about the real world, Gillespie? Even the air you breathe is artificial. Why do you think Saddam Hussein didn't kill our boys with his anthrax and his botulism and all the other crap he created in his labs? 'Cause he knew we had something worse --

-- One mad man --
-- Every fucking dictator of the future's going to use biological weapons that you can manufacture cheap in a test tube with technology you can buy at the newsrack. Deterrence works. Gillespie, horrified, steps away from his boss as he begins to understand the scope of the deception which he has been the victim of.
We spent years synthesizing an antibody that worked with the original African strain. We assumed it would work with this Bonneville strain. We gambled. We lost. We can't afford to lose again...
So you're going to wipe out this entire town -- kill everyone in it?
The virus is going to reach the river.
Take the people who are well and get them out!
If even one were sick, no matter where we were, the disease would start again. Beat, Gillespie knows he's right.
Your only hope is to look for the host.
I did -- for thirty years.
Let me.

You might be contaminated.
I know I'm not.
We have facilites to hold a few people in quarantine. Get out now. Take your team.
Izzy is sick, Robby infected. Beat.
I'm sorry. Beat.
Wipe out the town, wipe out Motaba. And you're still the only one in the world who's got the virus. No matter what, your program's secure.
That's not a consideration.
Bullshit! CUT TO:
Salt looks outside, worried:
HOLD on Salt's face scared. Robby has as yet no sign of the fever. She and Gillespie pour over the fax from Lisa Aronson.
No goodbyes. It's bad luck.
I'm glad you were here. CUT TO:
Atten-shun! The soldiers salute Gillespie and Salt.
Sergeant, General Ford has ordered us to decon all aircraft before takeoff.

But we've been doing it at the base, sir.
Vector transmission is increasing and airborne contamination must be minimized. Pretty soon, Sergeant, even that suit won't protect you.
Yes, sir. Salt takes hold of Sergeant Meyer's walkie-talkie. The Sergeant is puzzled by this but says nothing as Salt sprays it thoroughly with disinfectant before handing it back. He sprays the outside of the chopper, then moves inside.
The pilot is inside, sir!
I'll get him out. CUT TO:
What the hell?

Nice and easy now. The Black Hawk cruises over the camp, blending right in with half-a-dozen other choppers going in all directions. CUT TO:
There's food and water for two days. They'll find you by then. Gillespie slips on Deterich's uniform, Salt pulls on Gillespie's.
You never expected to make Colonel this fast, did you, Salt? CUT TO:
Not bad for somebody who hasn't flown in six years.
Seven. Want to see my loop-d- loop?
Just kidding, sir. Gillespie studies the air map of the Pacific Ocean.
Cut inland at Klamath River and keep this mountain ridge between us and Oregon.
To San Jose, sir?
No. Ford will anticipate that.
Lisa Aronson sent us all the shipping records...
No, not all... Just the ones Biotest had.
Problems.
You're Gillespie, you don't trust the C.D.C., you don't trust anybody... you'd want to look at all the data yourself. Ford turns to an aide, Lieutenant Richardson:
Issue an all-points bulletin to every police department on the West Coast. Start with San Jose. Colonel Gillespie and Captain Salt are armed, and assumed to be contaminated until proven otherwise... CUT TO:

Excuse me.
I am Warrant Officer Deterich of the United States Army -- The NEXT PERSON in line reacts:
I just came from the site of the virus epidemic in Oregon and you will help me now! Armistead's supervisor, MRS. PANAMIDES, comes out of her office as the other persons waiting in line, fearful of the dreaded Motaba Virus, edge away from Gillespie rapidly.
Bills of lading for all ships which arrived from Africa during the last six months.
An animal.
I don't know. CUT TO:
That's it. The Apeldoorn, a Dutch freighter. One monkey. But what kind of monkey?
climbing into the Black Hawk. The RAIN is much heavier now. CUT TO:

I tried to radio. All static. 'Cause of the storm.
So 'cause of the storm, you want me to fly twenty miles through a gale and hover while I drop you on board a ship at sea?
Yes.
Sir, with all respect -- no fuckin' chance. Beat. Gillespie is dead serious.
The storm won't break 'til tomorrow. Salt is torn.
If you want, I could try to hover and drop you on board.
No way. CUT TO:
Colonel, I couldn't find my umbrella in this rain. Despair. A long beat. Then In the distance through the mist, a red light flashes. CUT TO:

Ready for drop.
Speak for yourself. On the deck of the Apeldoorn Four crewmen hold tight onto their lifelines and wait for -- Gillespie, who emerges from the belly of the chopper. He hangs tight onto the winch, which strains in the wind, thrusting Gillespie over the waves. One breaks on top of him.
How long has it been since the monkey was on the ship? One of the seamen translates Gillespie's question to the CAPTAIN in Dutch. The Captain answers in halting English:
When did Seaman Jans first get sick?

Captain, your ship will have to be quarantined at sea. No one is to go near this freezer. Do you understand? The Captain nods, overwhelmed by sudden fear.

Nobody move! Gillespie sits down beside the Anchor. He shrinks back as Gillespie leans over, grabs his lapel mike and pins it on himself.
I am not infected. One of the two cameramen backs away from his camera and bolts toward the door. Salt points the gun at him, but doesn't pull the trigger. More and more people stampede out.

Shake it, Colonel! Gillespie talks into the camera with the red light on.
We need help to find the animal carrying the Motaba Virus. It is a small black and white monkey and it was brought to Northern California or Oregon within the last two weeks. If you have any information about this monkey, please call this number at the C.D.C. in Atlanta.
Many people are going to die. This is their only chance. Please... Help us... Gillespie bolts up. He and Salt run out of the newsroom. FADE UP POLICE SIRENS and -- CUT TO:

If you have any information about this monkey, please call... HOLD ON Mrs. Jeffries' face. SMASH CUT TO:

I'm gonna fly into the heaviest radar surveillance on Earth on account of something that might have been seen by a toddler?
We know that Jimbo Scott took an animal up to Bonneville to sell. This place, Molalla, would be right on the way to the airport. Gillespie studies the map.
To get back up there we're gonna haveta fly through everything the Air Force has got. Are you feelin' lucky, Captain?
Luck ain't gonna be enough. Salt pushes the wheel down, until the Black Hawk is just a few feet above the tall redwood trees. He veers to avoid -- A particularly tall redwood -- and misses it by inches, whacking off a few of its upper branches with the rotor blades.
'Course -- a little luck won't hurt us any.

It moves like a truck, it reflects radar like a truck, but guess what? It ain't a truck.
We got him! McClintock smiles, grabs his flight helmet and races --

Gentlemen, I have in my hand the final authorization to proceed, signed by the President. I know that each of us has doubts about what we are about to do. It is only human to have doubts when you are commanded to take the lives of other human beings. Remember your wives, remember your children... they will all get the disease and die if we let fear govern our hearts. We are doing what is right, and what the nation requires of us. PAN ACROSS the grim faces.
I expect each man to do his duty. I know you won't fail. CUT TO:
The monkey!
No, it's moving too fast.
picks up another swirl of red on the infra-red sensing device. He points to it.
Circle in.
stares at the monitor. A faint red band appears in the corner of the screen, then disappears.
Starboard! The chopper veers to the right and the red band glows brighter and brighter.
Lock! The chopper hovers, then starts to descend straight down. Gillespie looks through binoculars at:

Drive her down! She falls from that height, she'll bleed out. Gillespie jams cartridges containing turquoise liquid into the M-16. He FIRES. The bullets land above Betsy. She jumps onto a lower branch. The bullets keep coming. She jumps onto:
FIRES again.
Up! Fast! Salt yanks the wheel back. The Black Hawk starts climbing. The Apaches quickly surround it. INTERCUT:
Give me the monkey, Mike. The Black Hawk climbs higher and higher, through the thick layer of clouds, now absolutely black in the darkness of the night.
If the antibodies work, we'd have a way to stop the epidemic by medical means --
-- We have no way to produce them in quantity --
-- Dr. Iwabi --
There's no time for that now. In the lead Apache, snipers lean out the window. Their telescopic sights lock on Gillespie and Salt. McCLINTOCK Give me an order to fire, sir. We don't need the monkey.
You do. Because if you fail to contain the virus, you're going to be racing to synthesize an antiserum. How long did it take you to do the last one? A year? Two years? Five? Ford's torn.
If the monkey's antibody is effective, you could use it as a template. Maybe you could save Europe. Ford hesitates. McCLINTOCK Sir, let me -- The Black Hawk blasts through the cloud cover and emerges:
Fire away! Nothing's going to survive the crash.
You've got until midnight, Mike. CUT TO:
What?
I like it all right.
It's okay, 'cause from now on you can call me Hurricane.
I like it.
Good, 'cause I'm giving you a new name, too. Guess what it is? Izzy's lips go dusky, his breathing only short gasps.
Tell me.
Guess. Gillespie's voice breaks:

I can't. Izzy's dead. Tears stream down Gillespie's cheeks. CUT TO:
I'm scared. So scared. He comes toward her.
No false hope. No games.
You can't give up.
Just be with me. He cups her hands in his gloved hand.
How's Izzy?
He's gonna be okay. You're both going to be okay.
Stay with me! Fight! She half opens her eyes, her voice a murmur.
Hold... me. He puts his arms around her. Screams into helmet radio:
Salt, where the hell are you? Salt, answer me!

Remember the first time we made love? In France. Behind the haystack. And we were so worried that the little boy on the bicycle might see us. She smiles, remembering.
I never felt anything except with you, Robby. I was so stupid to let it slip away. She closes her eyes. A cry of anguish:
Salt! Beat. Then Salt appears in the doorway holding a large plastic bag of Betsy's antiserum. Gillespie connects it to Robby's IV and the brown fluid flows into Robby. Gillespie sits down beside her. A long beat. Then he does Something crazy. He removes the glove from his biosafety suit so that his own bare hand can touch Robby's skin. He touches her face gently. HOLD ON Gillespie, sitting beside his wife's bed, holding her hand.
I was wrong. The antiserum doesn't work.

Take this. A signed declaration by me that at all times you were following my orders -- Now get out of here.
-- No, sir. Gillespie's moved:
You'll be the only person left alive who knows the truth --
-- But, sir --
-- You will leave! You will not disobey an order.
Yes, sir.
All the parts move with such precision he should be proud. But he's deeply troubled. He moves:
General, we got a problem. It's rainin' pitchforks up heah. The damn rain will dilute it down, barely be strong enough to kill a cat.
To implement the plan and to kill only a portion of the population... That would cause great harm and solve nothing. McCLINTOCK Sir!! The nerve gas rapidly loses its potency after it's mixed. The choppers have got enough to make two runs. The virus is a quarter mile from the river. You've got to go forward.
Stand down!! Return your squadron to base and stand down until you receive further orders.
Acknowledge. Return to base. Ford moves into:

Napalm everything from the town outward. McCLINTOCK In the rain, the napalm will burn unevenly.
I'll take that chance.
I gave you my orders. Beat. Then quietly McCLINTOCK Let's say the antiserum did work, General. You'd bus out the people, move 'em somewhere, and treat 'em. And with luck some of them would live. But it's not going to work and in the meantime you don't understand what you've done.
I understand perfectly.

I'm sorry, but my decision stands. If there is any hope of avoiding this horrible contingency, I've got to... McClintock has slowly drawn his belt out of his trousers. He quickly throws it around Ford's neck, crosses it, and pulls violently on the two ends. Ford kicks and struggles, but he's no match for McClintock's strength. McCLINTOCK I am relieving you of command on the basis of cowardice in the face of a national emergency.
Yes, sir. CUT TO:
Stop! But nobody's listening. He runs down the hall screaming. CUT TO:
General McClintock, we are ready to commence phase one. McCLINTOCK Proceed.
Stop! The antiserum works. McCLINTOCK Turn it off! The radioman hesitates.
This is Colonel Gillespie. And I'm ordering you... begging you... to stop. We can save these people. McClintock punches off the radio.

You do this, every night for the rest of your life you will wake up screaming. INTERCUT Sandman One. A long beat.
This is Sandman One... we are returning to base. McCLINTOCK You will be shot for dereliction of duty in a national crisis. Do you understand? Sandman One doesn't answer. McClintock turns to the Young Major. McCLINTOCK Order him to proceed. The Young Major hesitates. McClintock points the gun at his head. The Young Major trembles, but shakes his head "no."
No! McClintock turns the gun to Salt.
As the ranking officer, you are in command... Until --
Colonel Gillespie gets here. Gillespie pulls his coat up over his head to shield himself from the driving RAIN and begins to run toward the quarantine perimeter. DISSOLVE TO:
pushing Robby on her gurney into an Army truck. He seals the back tight with tape. Then climbs inside:
A gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo, almost under her breath.
...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...
Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You want to call 'em down on us?
Mr. Gibbs.
That will do.
She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog-- mark my words.
Consider them marked. On your way.
'Aye, Captain. Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Think again, Miss Swan. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirates brand, gets what he deserves a short drop and a sudden stop.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
My apologies, Governor.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, dear... we will be landing in Port Royal very soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Yes, father.
I still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate...
Look! A boy! In the water!
Man overboard!
Boy overboard!
Fetch a hook! Haul him out of there!
He's still breathing.
Where did he come from?
Mary mother of God ...
What happened here?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Lot of good it did them... Everyone's thinking it! I'm just saying it! Pirates!
There is no proof of that. It could have been an accident. Captain, these men were protection. If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!
Of course not, Governor. Come about and strike the sails! Unlash the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off the cannons! Hope for the best...prepare for the worst. Move the boy aft. We'll need the deck clear.
Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy. He's in your charge now. You'll watch over him?
My name is Elizabeth Swann.
Will Turner.
I'm watching over you, Will.
You're a pirate.
Did he speak?
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Very good.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Yes -- yes.
Still abed at this hour? It's a beautiful day!
I have a gift for you.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Although...I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
I knew it.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a fine gentleman, don't you think? He fancies you, you know.
Elizabeth? How's it coming?
Difficult ... to say.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Women in London must have learned to not breath.
Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see you again!
Good day, sir. I have your order.

The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may -
Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the full width of the blade..
Impressive. .. very impressive. Commodore Norrington will be pleased, I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to your master.
I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated --
Elizabeth! You look stunning!
Will! It's so good to see you!
I dreamt about you last night. Will reacts with surprise "Really?
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate -
About the day we met. Do you remember?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Well said! There's a boy who understands propriety. Now, we must be going.
Good day, Mr. Turner.
Good day.
Elizabeth.
Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington. After all, it is only
It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited?
No ... someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
This must be some important boat.
Ship.
Ship.
Captain Norrington's made it his flagship. He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake.
Commodore.
Right. Commodore Norrington.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is. I've seen it.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
Yes, I have.
... No .
No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
... no.
You!
Get away from there! You don't have permission to be aboard there!
I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship.
What's your name?
Smith.
And no lies!
None? Very well. You've rumbled me. I confess I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating.
I said, no lies.
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
If he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us.
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you.
May I have a moment?
You look lovely. Elizabeth.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.
This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career. But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved. The thing all men most require a marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
I can't breathe.

Elizabeth! .
The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she missed them!
Aren't you going to save her?
Sailors.
Fine.
Don't lose these.
Not breathing.
Move.
I never would have thought of that.
Clearly, you've never been to Singapore.
Where did you get this?
On your feet.
Elizabeth! Are you all right?
Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?
I believe thanks are in order.
Had a brush-up with the East India Trading Company, did you ... pirate?
Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette, fetch some irons.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.
I don't see your ship -- Captain.
He said he'd come to commandeer one.
I told you he was telling the truth. These are his, sir.
Extra powder, but no additional shot.
It doesn't bear true.
I half-expected it to be made of wood.
Taking stock you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship. You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Carefully, lieutenant.
Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Indeed.
Finally.
Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and belt, please.
Commodore!
Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Now, if you'll be very kind?
You are despicable.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
On his heels! Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.
Here, dear ... you should wear this.
Thank you, Father ... and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please.
Right where I left you.
Not where I left you.
You're the one they're hunting. The pirate.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ...
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Only a little.
You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ... Excellent form ... But how's your footwork? If I step here -
Very good! And if I step again, you step again. . .
Ta!
That's a good trick. Except, once again, you are between me and the way out. And now you have no weapon.
Who makes all these?
I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ... I can kill him.
You cheated.
Pirate.
Move away.
No.
Move!
No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you.
Excellent work, Mister Brown. You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.
I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
Nice and toasty. Thank you, Estrellia.
You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
No. She hasn't.
Well, she had a taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Bleak. Very bleak.
What was that?
Cannon fire!
I know those guns!
It's the Black Pearl.
There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.
Governor! Barricade yourself in my office! That's an order!
They've flanked us! Men! Swords and pistols!
Up there!
Listen, Estrella -- they haven't seen you. Hide, and first chance, run for the fort .
We know you're here, poppet. Come out and we promise we won't hurt you.
We will find you, poppet ... You've got something of ours, and it calls to us!
The gold calls to us!
Hello, poppet.
Please, no ...
Par. .. Parlay!
What?
Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
I know the code.
If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
It would appear, so do you.
She wants to be taken to the Captain, and she'll go without a fuss.
We must honor the code.
It's all right, doggie ... come here,
What's the matter, boy?
This isn't the armory.
Well, well... Look what we have here, Twigg. It's. Captain Sparrow.
Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it.
Did you sprout little wings and flyaway?
His fortunes aren't improved much.
Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers.
You are cursed.
The stories are true.
You know nothing of hell.
She's invoked the right of parlay... with Captain Barbossa.
I am here to --
And you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay!
My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. What is it you want?
I want you to leave. And never come back.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means' No. '
Very well.
I'll drop it!
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship.
Did you, now?
Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it.
NO!
You have a name, missy?
Elizabeth - Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household. Barbossa reacts to the name Turner it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.
You've got sand, for a maid.
Thank you, sir.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Can I trust you?
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Our bargain. . ?
Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -
First. Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing. Secondly you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. And you're not. And thirdly...
Miss Swann! Elizabeth!
They've taken her! They've taken Elizabeth!
We're aware of the situation.
We have to hunt them down -- and save her!
Where do you propose we start? If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone does, tell me! Leave, Mr. Turner.
That Jack Sparrow... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Still --
We can ask him where it is -- maybe he can lead us to it!
That pirate tried to kill my daughter. We could never trust a word he said!
We could strike a bargain -
No. The pirates who invaded this fort left Sparrow locked in his cell. Ergo, he is not their ally, and therefore of no value. We will determine their most likely course, and launch a search mission that sails with the tide.
That's not good enough. This is Elizabeth's life!
Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth. Now, go home.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Somewhat.
Where does it make berth?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
The ship's real enough. So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never. They took Miss Swann.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.
I can get you out of here.
How? The key's run off.
I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . .
Your name is Turner.
Yes. Will Turner.
Will Turner... I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl. Do we have an accord?
Agreed.
Agreed!
Someone will have heard that. Hurry.
Not without my effects.
We need to go!
Why are you bothering with that?
My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?
I'd die for her.
Good.
Ah, now there's a lovely sight!
I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her. Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way...
Come aboard.
I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. It's been a sound policy.
No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably.
We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
It's still against the law.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start. My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
Aye! Avast!
You're serious about this.
Dead serious.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
We'll see about that.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.
As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
A little help?
I can't believe he's doing this.
You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either.
Do you have any idea, boy, what you're doing?
No.
Lookee there, mate! We're underway!
Commodore --
A moment.
But --
Please.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Rash, Turner, too rash.
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate I have ever seen.
They're coming!
Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges!
Can you swim? Can. You. Swim?
Good.
Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!
Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!
Raise the sails.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons! We are to fire on our own ship?
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
So it would seem.
He's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.
So it would seem.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Fine.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Dare I ask the fate of its previous owner?
Now, none of that. Please dig in.
No need to stand on ceremony, and no call to impress anyone. You must be hungry.
Try the wine.
And the apples -- one of those next.
It's poisoned!
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Then why aren't you eating?
Would that I could.
Do you not know what this is, then?
It's a pirate medallion.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta .
Ah, so you don't know as much as you pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the New World, a high priest gave. him all the gold they had, with one condition that he spare the people's lives. Of course, Cortes being Cortes, he didn't. He'd've made a great pirate, that one.
So the priest, with his dying breath, called on the power of the blood of his people, and put on the gold a curse. If anyone took so much as a single piece, as he was compelled by greed, by greed he would be consumed.
Within a day of leaving port for Spain, the treasure ship carrying the gold ... something went wrong. The ship run aground, every man aboard dead, save one. He survived long enough to hide the gold ashore.
That's all very interesting, but I hardly believe in ghost stories any more.
You idiot girl! It's no make- believe! My crew and I, we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we took it all. Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange
There is but one way to remove the curse. All of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full, and the blood repaid.
Apple?
I'm curious -- after killing me, what is it you were planning to do next?
Look! LOOK! The moonlight shows us for what we really are! We are not among the living and so we cannot die -
-- but neither are we dead! We have all the desires of the living, but cannot satisfy them! Ten years I have been parched of thirst, and unable to quench it! Ten years, I have been starving to death -- and haven't died!
And I have not felt anything for ten years ... Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea ... ... nor the flesh of a woman ...
You'd best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner. Because now you're in one.
The Interceptor cuts across the waves. Jack at the wheel; Will tightens a line, moves back astern.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy. After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
My father. William Turner?
I'm not a simpleton. At the jail - - it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. Since that's what I wanted, I didn't press the matter. But now -
I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
'Bootstrap?'
Good man. Good pirate. And clever -"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true that my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable
My father did not think of my mother -his family -- as a burden.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again.
You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. Must, Should, do, don't, shall, shall not -- those are just suggestions. There are only two absolute rules.
What a man can do. And what a man can I t do.
For instance you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man... or you can't. Now me, I can sail this ship to Tortuga, by myself. . . But I can't just let you drown.
Tortuga?
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
We need a crew. We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter -
Just do it quickly.
Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster -- there!
You stole my boat.
AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together -
Borrowed. Borrowed your boat. Without permission.
My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it?
Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back. Or one better.
I will.
Jack! Over here!
He knows Gibbs.
Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Aye, that'll about do it.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
I know. That was for the smell.
Just the one.
Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
First -- have you found me a crew?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
I'm going after the Black Pearl.
Say again?
Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where its going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.
A fool's errand.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
And you've got that, have you?
Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner.
Well, lookee there. I'll allow you may be onto something, Jack. There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. I'll find some men.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
That he is.
Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt --
You owe me a boat.
Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out --
-- so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him, nobody knows how. Nobody knows the parrot's name, neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's parrot.'
Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death?
Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'
That goes for the rest of you! Danger and near certain death. For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann. An equal share of the reward shall be -
Shut up, before you lose them all!
These are the only ones worth having. And we're going to need them-
That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides!
Werd best drop canvas, sirl
She can hold a bit longer.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
We're catching up!
Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta, off the port bow!
Bring her in, not too close. I won't brave the reef, not until high tide. We lay anchor before dark.
... that is, if it first doesn't sink back down to hell from where it came.
The Interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sails set wing-to-wing.
Bear three points starboard.
Six points port!
Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun, or it's bad luck! Anty-clockwise.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie.
Really? So ... what's the story on the pistol?
I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -
What? He never told me that.
Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share. So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the bearings. That night, there was mutiny.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
How did he get off the island?
I didn't!
My body's still there, rotting away, and I am but a ghost!
How did you get off the island?
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate -
Barbossa.
Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.
Hah! Be mindful of pits and crevasses. Stay together.
Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day -- for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here.
How does he do that?
They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island -
The curse drove you to gather this?
Aye. And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded. But it will drive us no longer.
What's that?
Depends.
On what?
On whether the stories are all true. If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon. If not -
-- well, too late.
Chalk one up for the stories.
Here we stand before the cursed treasure of Cortez himself. Won by blood, it demands blood in return.
What did you expect? We're all gentlemen here, right and proper.
You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples.
What was begun by blood, let blood now end!
Did it work?
You're not dead.
It didn't work! The curse is still upon us!
You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?! Was your father William Turner?!
No.
Where's his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?! Where?
She had the medallion! She's the right age. She said her name was Turner!
You brought us here for nothing?
If you had sailed with Morgan for ten years like I have, you'd know not to question me!
If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! Any more talk, I'll chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths!
You?!
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
You?!
Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you! It's going badly!
This way!
I'm glad we got here in time.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away.
Come on!
No. This won't work. I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
No.
I'll lead them away.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy.
Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
I invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew...
I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack Sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don't lose that grin from your face.
The woman's blood didn't work, did it?
I know who's blood you need, to end the curse.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No you won't.
Now?
Now. No, don't kill him.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.
The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
That's right.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
I'm a man of my word.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'll torture it out of you.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.
Wait as long as you like.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
Track you down and -
And if I tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact. Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.
Pintel ... set sail. If this fool plan is to work, we'll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which brought 'em here.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I'll watch my back.
Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig. Meaning no disrespect, of course.
Two women on board? A man don't have to be superstitious to know that's trouble.
... you were in danger ... so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work.
Why would my father send this to me?
To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known-
-- then we never would have met.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Shift your heading, steer clear of that island. Fifteen degrees starboard.
Can we outrun them?
Not a chance. Make for the reef.
What's he doing? Is he going to run her aground?
Drop the forward anchor!
With its forward momentum and the anchor down, the Interceptor to turn quickly, pivoting around the anchor.
All hands! Prepare to come about!
Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel - I'm a little conflicted, here.
Strike your colors, you bloody cockroaches!
Looks like they mean to send us under.
There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger,
It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as well.
We're not going to just surrender!
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few-
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board, you played me right clever, make pretending and all. I hope your stay this time is more pleasant. Boys, show her some hospitality!
She goes free!
What's in your head, boy?
She. Goes. Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You can't. I can.
No!
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid -
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
It's true - he's the spittin' image of old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!
Looks like you're back to having nothing to offer.
And hers got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Enough of that! Name your terms.
Elizabeth goes free!
We got that part. Anything else?
And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. I f you agree... then... I will remain with you.
Agreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune -
Will -- you can't trust him.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Eh? You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Boatswain! Take your captives belowdecks. Chain them in the galley, and teach 'em how to row.
Hah. Look there. That's the very same island we made Jack governor of on our last trip. When you sail the open sea as long as I, you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way.
Amen to that...
Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick. Men, break out the plank!
No! You gave your word!
Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. I agreed to set them free. I didn't say when. .. nor where.
The Black Pearl lies at anchor, closer now to the islet.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.
Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
By the Powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.
Tell you what. I'll give you one pistol, and let you be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself! That is, presuming you're not both drownded.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That's fair.
The lady's next. But first, I'll be wanting that dress back, if you please.
Here -- it will go well with your black heart !
I will not walk into the ocean. You'll have to throw me in!
Have at her, lads!
Elizabeth breaks the surface, looks around. And then, finally Jack appears, sucking in air. He shows what he went after his pistol. He tucks it into his shirt.
You went back for that? We need to head for the reef!
That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship.
Not all that big, is it?
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
The trees are taller.
I hope you have no intention of using that.
Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.
Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
What is that? Is there a boat under there?
What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
It won't. It won't, and so we won't.
But ... you did it before! Last time -
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.
But from the looks of this, they've long been'out of business, and so that won't be happening again. We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
You should look at our contretemps this way we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Try it. It goes down rough, but it goes down - - and the second swig goes down easier.
And you will call me Miss Swann.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho...
What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Please,
Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.
Oh, no ... it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring -
That was before I met one, of course.
Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
More to drink!
Well?
We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho.
We kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho -
I LOVE this song! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters,
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really-is ... is freedom.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Ah, well... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.

We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To freedom.
To the Black Pearl.
What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
Yes, the rum is gone.
Why?
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could mass it?
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Exactly.
Just you wait, Captain. In an hour, maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open' and you'll be seeing white sails on that horizon!
They'll be no living with her after this.
Elizabeth, I'm" relieved you're safe. Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.
You're speaking up for him again?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
We had time to get to know each other.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
No. The pirates have taken Will -
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Commodore, please!
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Not as a condition -- a request.
Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to come about. He'll give you our heading.
Congratulations, sir.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
What?
I know now where your heart truly lies.
And now I know... where yours does, as well.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
That would hardly be proper.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage!
Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt.
That ain't going to work. That's the gun deck above yea
What happened to William Turner?
Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure -- to you, as it were so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain.
And then he ran. And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him.
That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over.
Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker. It was only after, we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse. That's what you call ironic.
Bring him.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Nor did you, I noticed.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
What's your plan?
Elizabeth -- below decks. I will not compromise your safety..
Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my quarters, and make sure she stays there.
I don't like the situation, mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You would do that?
They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Careful, now. You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.
You deserve to be cursed -- and remain cursed!
Blast him! A pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line! Fan out! Find him!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Jack!
Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
Are you certain this is the right way?
It's the right way.
Thank you, Jack Sparrow.
You couldn't have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going.
You did know where you were going! You did lead us directly to them! Why?
What was begun by blood, let blood now end!
You don't want to be doing that.
No, I really think I do.
All right then.
Why don't I want to do this?
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Jack!
- - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Do you believe him?
No. But him I believe. He is genuinely angry.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
What're you suggesting?
Simple. Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment.
Like after you've killed... Every... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end 80 well for you.
The situation has changed.
That so?
Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.
I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.' Do we have an accord?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Men! Are you up for it?
Mr. Pintel, select five men to stay here. Take the rest of the men out ... not through the caves.
There's ... another exit?
Aye, for us there is.
Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns on the beach, and set your aim. Wait for my signal, we don't want to spook them.
All the men in place, sir. Ready to fire.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Men! Take cover!
You've been planning this from the beginning. Since you learned my name.
Oh, please -- do I really seem that clever?
Use it well.
Confound it, Jack -- I was actually beginning to like you!
Steady, men! Remember -- we're the Navy!
What is happening out there?
They're on our side! Take heart, men!
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
You can't beat me, Jack.
Jack!
Well, isn't that interesting.
They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one. It's a curse, I guess.
So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day?
Or you could surrender.
Or I could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate your folly forever.
Hah. Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
He didn't waste it.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of. You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can It betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?
The worst. On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate.
Let's get out of here.
You're all right!
Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers? And how did you get off the island?
Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it.
There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter- that we are of a different class -
It doesn't!
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
This is a proper kiss.
Tough luck. I was rooting for you.
...and though I do say so with regret, the law is clear. The penalty for piracy is death by hanging.
By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy. It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire to do good, at great personal risk. It seems to me, that in the rare occasion where the right course is committing an act of piracy, then an act of piracy is the right course! So in my capacity as Governor, I intend to grant a pardon to --
Sir!
Jack and his crew have escaped! There was no damage to the cell ... they must have been set free.
The Black Pearl!
Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
I don't think that will be necessary.
A day's head start. That's all he gets.
Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl is yours!
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!
Where were you, Jason?
In the car. Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook -- *
-- it hasn't been two years -- *
-- it's alwa ys bad and it's never * anything but bits and piece s anyway! * * You ever thi nk that maybe i t's just * making it wo rse? You don't wonder that? *
We write them down because sooner or * later you're going to remember something * good. *
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
Sleep. Sleep now.
I should be better by now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But it ends up the same.
One day it will be different. It just takes time. We'll make new memories. You and me.
THE STREET. A SILVER CAR -- something newish -- pulling down the block -- can't quite see who's driving, but --
BOURNE watching this silver car. So serious he's casual. Nobody passing would notice, but we do He's on alert.
BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --
THE SILVER CA R has par ked. There's a GUY -- well-dressed -- cas ual -- phy sical -- sunglasses -- call him KIRILL -- he's out of the ca r and hea ding across the street toward a bui lding ther e. A TEL EGRAPH OFFICE.
BOURNE checking his watch. The car. The guy. Perimeter.
We gotta go, Marie. We gotta go, now.
We're blown.
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy. *
BOURNE not liking this. Eyes all over -- trying to decide.
But you're sure?
He was at the campground yesterday.
So... *
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and * hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
That's crazy. *
No. Not thi s. This is real. * * And he's rig ht there... *
Where --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- * silver -- *
-- Jesus! -- -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
What have you got, Survey One?
"All teams -- listen up -- we are standing- by for final green."
It's a lot of money, Pam.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. * It's not something we can go out and * comparison shop. *
"-- repeat -- who is dark? -- the target building or your location? --"

We need to get in there.
I'm working on it.
-- so there were two of the se explosive charges plac ed on the power lines. One of * them failed. The fingerpri nt... * That's from the one that di dn't go off.
And the Germans can't match it?
Nobody's got it. We checked every database we could access. Nothing.
Show her the other thing.
This is a KG B file that must've fallen somehow and then slipped under, I guess, a desk there, or...
Do we know what this says?
Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as Treadstone.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Yes?
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay- grade.
Tha t's a warrant from Director Marshall gra nting me unrestricted access to all per sonnel and materials associated with Tre adstone.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know abou t it? It was a kil l squad. Black on black. * Closed down two years ago. *

Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. * Not around h ere. * You better t ake this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Let's talk about Conklin.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I want to know what happened.
d? Jason Bourn e happened. What happene You've got t he files? Then let's cut the * crap. It we nt wrong. Conk lin had these * guys wound s o tight they we re bound to snap.

Bou rne was h is number one - - guy went out to work, scr ewed the op and never cam e bac k. Conkl in couldn't fix it, could n't * fin d Bourne, couldn't adjus t. It all went sid eways. F inally there we re no opti ons * lef t.
So you had Conklin killed. I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
I've given t hirty years and two marri ages to this agen cy. I've shove led shit o n * four contine nts. I'm due t o retire n ext year and bel ieve me, I need my pensio n, but if you t hink I'm gonna sit here a nd let you dang le me with this , you can go to hell. Marsh all too. It had to be done.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
It hink I do . We had a dea l going down in Berlin la st week. Durin g the buy, both our Fie ld Agent and th e seller were killed. We pulled a finger print from a * timing charg e that didn't g o off. They were ki lled by Jason Bourne.
They're ready for us upstairs.


Do you know what his budget was? *
Excuse me.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing * it at him and asking him to keep it dark. *
May I finish? *
Conklin migh t've been a nut , but he * wasn't a mol e. You have me his calendar * for a couple of days, I'll prove he * killed Linco ln. * This is supp osed to be defi nitive?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's yo ur theory? Conklin's re aching out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is d ead.
No one's disputing that, Ward.
For crissake, Marty, you knew Conklin. Does this scan? I mean, at all?
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. *

And that wha tever information I was going * to buy in Be rlin, it was big enough to * make Bourne come out from wherever he's * been hiding to kill again. * * How's that s can? *
...what can I do? I can't. I'll call you when I know what I'm into... I don't know , some guy's name came up on the computer . So start wit hout me, if I can get there, I will. Later ...
Alright, Mr. Bourne, is that your name? Name's Nevin s. I'm with the US Consulate. Could I see your passport?
So, Mr. Bourne...
Are you travelling alone? *
Yes...
Hello?
Enough. I want both of you on that plane. *

And we are - - all of us -- going to d o * what we were either too laz y or inept to * do the last time around -- you're goi ng to * find this so nofabitch and t ake him do wn before he de stroys any more of this agency. Is that defi nitive enough for you?
"...a week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin, one a highly..."
So your cover at the time was what?
That I was an American student in Paris.
What exactly did your job with Treadstone in Paris consist of?
Ih ad two re sponsibilities. One was to coo rdinate l ogistical operations. Th e oth er was to monitor the health of th e age nts, to m ake sure they were up to date wit h their m edications.
Health, meaning what?
Their mental health. Because of what they'd been through. They were prone to a variety of problems.
* What kind of problems?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Were you familiar with the training program?
The details? No. I mean, I was told it was voluntary. I don't kno w if that's true or not, but that's wha t I was told. Look, they took vulnerable subjects, okay? You mix that with th e right pharmacology and some serio us behavior modification, and, I don't know, I mean, I guess anything's possible .
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
If you say so. *
* Not good eno ugh. You're the person who * flo ated this amnesia story. * * Eve r feel so rry for him? For what he'd bee n through ?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out. *
See , that's a problem for me, Nicky. * Wha tever he's doing, we need to end it. * Thi s isn't the kind of mess you walk away * fro m. *
Is it him?
He's not hiding, that's for sure.
Why Naples? Why now?
Maybe he's running.
On his own passport?
What's he doing? He's making his first mistake...
It's not a m istake. They don't m ake mistakes. And they don't do random. There's always an objective, * always a tar get. * * If he's in N aples, on his own passport, * there's a re ason. *

I emptied it.
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Sorry. Old habits.
You still should've moved.
I like it here.

Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive.
What do you want?
Conklin.
He's dead.
Try again.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
Nobody. They shut it down. We're the last two. It's over...
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
She really d id that? Told you not to kill me? I had a woma n once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. Y ou can't tell them who you are...
I did.
I thought you were here to kill me.
What did you do?
I'm sorry.
How long? How long do I have --
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
-- take the back -- get another car --
So he beats a man within an inch of his * life, strang les him, then blows the place * up? * For someone with amnesia, he certainly hasn't forgo tten how to kill, has he?
-- hey! -- they've got him boxed in! --
Forget it. They lost him.
What're you talking about? They've got a three block perimeter.
You can't see him? He's not in front of you? Forget it. He's gone.
You better start listening to someone. * Cause we've been there. *
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
And why is that?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd * do. He's coming for us.
BOURNE catching his breath -- shifting away from the pain in his rib -- checking his watch -- but what the hell is that on his sleeve? -- fuck, it's BLOOD -- JARDA's blood --
GRETKOV above. Watching him go.
THE FERNSEHTURM looming as they pass, the Berlin TV Tower. That needle in the sky. From the flashback. And then --
Neski. Hotel Brecker. Papers. *
Yes, sir.




Anything?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose. *
BOURNE walking right past them -- he's got the whole thing scoped -- heading quickly across the street and --

As they pile out of the van, start inside. Acknowledged by a SECURITY DETAIL pretending to loiter outside. As we hear:
-- Munich to Berlin, check everything -- flights -- t rains -- police reports -- that'll be B ox #1, Teddy that's yours --

Is it fresh?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Pamela Landy.
Who is this?
Bourne?
I want to come in.
Okay, how do you want to do it? *
I want someone I know to take me in. *
Who?
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
What if we can't find her?
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got.
Snipers? Hold on -- he said he wants to * come in.
My ass he do es. You're pla ying with fire, Pam ela. Mar shall said nail him to the * wal l. I don 't know how you interpreted * tha t, but I don't think he meant * rep atriate h im. *
Don't you want answers?
There are no answers. Ther e's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for on e would prefer the latter. And what abo ut her? You just sen d her out to th is lunatic with no protectio n?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him. *
Alright...
Where's Nicky?
Goddamn it -- I told you.
Listen! Listen!
What were my words? Leave me alo ne! Leave me out of it! But you coul dn't do that, could you?
I did...Jason, I swear, I did...I told them... I told them I believed you...
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE? *
What's she doing?
Why is she trying to kill me? *
They know! They know yo u were here. T hey know you killed these two guys. The y know you and Conklin had something on th e side. They don't know w hat it is, but they know!
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
What is this, a game?
I want to hear it from you.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was goi ng to sell-out a mole or something. I hav en't been debriefed on exactly what it was .
And you got to him before we could.
I killed him???
You left a p rint! There was Kel that did n't go of f! There was a partial print, the y tracked it back to Treadstone! They kno w it's yo u!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking * people. *
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
Why are you here, then? *
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job. *
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
No...Jason...please...
I was here!
... it's not in the file...I swear...I kno w your file...your first job was * Gen eva!...I swear to God you never worked * her e!... *
Got it, yeah . Hang on... Oka y, they'v e got three guys out front * and another two taking the back stairs. * No word on N icky. *
So what's he doing? You believe him? *
ZORN moving through the bullpen, carrying a cup of coffee, heading back toward PAMELA'S OFFICE where --
Sir...
Thanks.
She say what time I should call?
The sooner the better.
Id id my box work, but I wa nted to sh ow you before I showed Landy. I came ou t * her e last ni ght because non e of this was mak ing any s ense. I mean, I'm with y ou on thi s, Conkli n was a nut, bu t a traito r? I jus t can't g et there.
What do you have, Danny?
You put a fo ur-gam Kel on h ere and it's gon na take o ut power to the building. You kno w that. What you can't know, is if it' s gonna b low the room wi th it.
And?
The re were t wo charges, they were supposed to go off si multaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down her e... Fir st of all , this is nothi ng, it's a sub- lin e for the breaker above. Second, why put the char ge all the way down here? If you 're good enough to get i n here and han dle the g ear, you're goo d enough to kno w you don 't need this. Bou rne would know.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Jesus...
Oka y. What if someone decided to cover the ir tracks by blaming Conklin and Bou rne. Wha t if Bourne didn't have any thing to do with this?
Keep going...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Lots of people...
Including Landy... She had access to the archives.
Who else knows about this?
Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Okay...
Guten Abend.
No. Sorry. I just got in... I -- Is room 645 available? I stayed the re before. My wife and I.
Sure. That's fine. Danka.
THE FAX -- BOURNE'S FACE -- the same "wanted" picture and --
THE SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY. Suddenly scary.
-- go -- take the van! --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
-- five, six minutes --
-- Kurt -- you're here! -- keep the comm line open! --

Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dar k t-shirt. He says they 're gonna try and corral the guests on th e street over there, and then check them o ut, but...
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
I want to look at the room. * * Check it out. *
They missed him?
He let her go? Great. Where's Danny? * He should head over there and debrief * her. * * What's here? What was he doing? *
We don't know. They're in a room upstairs. I was told to wait down here.
OK, if you see Danny tell him I went back * to the hotel. *
On the rail and JUMPING even as the FIRST SHOT is fired --
You told me Bourne was dead.
There was a mistake.
I'l l say. You killed his goddam * gir lfriend instead. Now they're onto * Nes ki. They're at the Brecker Hotel even * as we speak. *
Will it track back to us? *
No. The files are spotless. Whatever * they find, it's just going to make Conklin * look worse. *
And the Landy woman? *
She's done everything I wanted. She bit * on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She * even found his bogus Swiss account... *
* The re's a bo dy in the basem ent. Dann y Zor n. He's got to disappea r. For go od. Cle an and fa st. I'll put h im in bed with Con klin and Bourne. Even t he girl, N icky. * Giv e me twen ty-four hours, I'll think it up. But get the goddamn bo dy out of the re.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, * there's no company, no fortune. You owe * me, Uri. One last push. *
One last push. One.

Here's what I've got. Remember Vla dimir Neski? R ussian * politician? Seven years ag o, he was due * to speak to a group of Euro pean Oil * ministers he re at the hotel . He never * did. He was murdered. *
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot * herself. * *
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything? *
It's starting to link up -- the hijacked * money -- the leak -- Pecos Oil -- one * last bit is Treadstone. *
Hey...
You do?
I only dream about people who are dead.
* Jason. You know exactly what to do. That * is your mission now. *
Sorry to wake you.
I wasn't sleeping. * * You OK? *
Bunch of stuff.
There's something else.
What?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne. *
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
We'll know for sure when we get the * security tapes. *
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
Da...
This is not a clean phone.
You're sure?
What? The tapes? *
Hold on... Yep. And Ab bott just direct dialed Moscow * from his roo m...
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
What do you mean?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Save it for Bourne.
What?
He left yest erday on the night train. He's probabl y just getting in now. You'll have to hurry.
Bourne comes here? Why?
Good luck.
Open it.
They go. You stay.
Yes. Now...
Sit down.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my * country. *
And pocketed a fair amount of change while * doing it. *
Why not? It was just money. *
And Danny Zorn, what was that? *
Had to be done. *



You wait. You understand? Stay.
Sure. No problem. I sit.
AN ABANDONED WOODEN HOUSE. Windows shattered and boarded up. Paint all but gone. Roof and gables all failing.
BOURNE crestfallen. Checking the address. This is it.
BOURNE and the OLD LADY -- she's pointing like she's giving directions -- when suddenly, the Driver's CELL PHONE RINGS -


Wait! Hey!


Sit. Can yo u...
I speak English.
Please...
Okay.
It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? * * Hmm? *
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No, I do. *
I would want to know. I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my fath er. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
What?
I would grow up thinking that they didn't love me if they just left me like that.
Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
I killed them.
You killed them.
They loved you. And I killed them.
For who? * KILLED FOR WHO?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
I should kill you...if it's true you should die...I should kill you now!
I can't let you do that either. *
Because you're afraid!
No. Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Hello, David. *
Where am I?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. * Before the w all fell you would have woken up in a Russ ian prison hospital.
Oh, shit...
Careful... *
Why am I alive?
Are you disappointed?
I know who you are.
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie. *
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
Why you're a live? You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive. Because we w ant you back on our side.
So?
Felt promising. It's a start. *
